Linux Namespace、Cgroup、rootfs 三方面，在宿主机之上为用户构建出互相隔离的进程运行环境。\n\nrootfs 作为容器镜像，是静态视图；\nNamespace + Cgroup 提供运行时隔离环境，是动态视图。\n\n显而易见，对于开发者而言，他们更关注于容器镜像。容器镜像，可以看做是以前的应用程序，它由开发者负责构建，并在开发、测试、发布等各个环节之间作为最核心的组件。\n在这种前提之下，云服务提供商的职责就从原来的 将用户提交的应用在虚拟机上运行起来，转变为 将用户提交的镜像以容器的方式运行起来。\n因此，整个生态必将以容器镜像为核心连接点，在生态链路的各个节点，如 CI/CD、监控、安全、网络、存储等，都需要转变为以容器镜像为根本。这将是一次云服务平台的结构化升级。\n容器从一个开发者手里的小工具，一跃成为了云计算领域的绝对主角；而能够定义容器组织和管理规范的 容器编排 技术，则当仁不让地坐上了容器技术领域的 头把交椅。这其中，其中翘楚当属 Docker 公司的 Compose+Swarm 组合，以及 Google 与 RedHat 公司共同主导的 Kubernetes 项目。\nKubernetes\nKubernetes 项目脱胎于 Google 的核心系统 Borg，在项目初期有有着很强的技术理论指导。\nBorg 系统，一直以来都被誉为 Google 公司内部最强大的 秘密武器。虽然略显夸张，但这个说法倒不算是吹牛。因为，相比于 Spanner、BigTable 等相对上层的项目，Borg 要承担的责任，是承载 Google 公司整个基础设施的核心依赖。在 Google 公司已经公开发表的基础设施体系论文中，Borg 项目当仁不让地位居整个基础设施技术栈的最底层。\n\n上图，来自于 Google Omega 论文的第一作者的博士毕业论文。它描绘了当时 Google 已经公开发表的整个基础设施栈。在这个图里，你既可以找到 MapReduce、BigTable 等知名项目，也能看到 Borg 和它的继任者 Omega 位于整个技术栈的最底层。\n正是由于这样的定位，Borg 可以说是 Google 最不可能开源的一个项目。而幸运的是，得益于 Docker 项目和容器技术的风靡，它终于得以以另一种方式与开源社区见面，这个方式就是 Kubernetes 项目。\n所以，相比于 小打小闹 的 Docker 公司、旧瓶装新酒 的 Mesos 社区，Kubernetes 项目从一开始就比较幸运地站上了一个他人难以企及的高度: 在它的成长阶段，这个项目每一个核心特性的提出，几乎都脱胎于 Borg/Omega 系统的设计与经验。更重要的是，这些特性在开源社区落地的过程中，又在整个社区的合力之下得到了极大的改进，修复了很多当年遗留在 Borg 体系中的缺陷和问题。\n所以，尽管在发布之初被批评是 曲高和寡，但是在逐渐觉察到 Docker 技术栈的 稚嫩 和 Mesos 社区的 老迈 之后，这个社区很快就明白了: Kubernetes 项目在 Borg 体系的指导下，体现出了一种独有的 先进性 与 完备性，而这些特质才是一个基础设施领域开源项目赖以生存的核心价值。\nKubernetes 解决了什么问题\n在说明 Kubernetes 解决了什么问题之前，先来讨论一下，用户期望 Kubernetes 有什么样的功能。\n对于大多数用户来说，他们希望 Kubernetes 项目带来的体验是确定的: 现在我有了应用的容器镜像，请帮我在一个给定的集群上把这个应用运行起来。\n更进一步地说，还希望 Kubernetes 能给我提供路由 网关、水平扩展、监控、备份、灾难恢复 等一系列运维能力。\n解决发现，这就是对于 PaaS(Cloud Foundry) 同等的诉求。\n但是，这些功能完全可以通过 Docker 及其生态圈 Docker Compose + Docker Swarm 自行实现，完全不知道实现一个 百万行代码量级 的 Kubernetes\n所以说，如果 Kubernetes 项目只是停留在拉取用户镜像、运行容器，以及提供常见的运维功能的话，那么别说跟 原生 的 Docker Swarm 项目竞争了，哪怕跟经典的 PaaS 项目相比也难有什么优势可言。\n而实际上，在定义核心功能的过程中，Kubernetes 项目是站在巨人 Borg 项目的肩膀之上，凭借 Borg 超前的理论优势，在短短几个月内迅速站稳了脚跟，进而确定了一个如下图所示的全局架构:\n\n可以看到，Kubernetes 项目的架构与原型项目 Borg 非常类似，都由 Master 和 Node 两种节点组成，分别用作控制节点和计算节点。\n其中，控制节点，即 Master 节点，由 三个 紧密协作的独立组件组合而成，它们分别是负责 API 服务的 kube-apiserver、负责调度的 kube-scheduler，以及 负责容器编排的 kube-controller-manager。整个集群的持久化数据，由 kube-apiserver 处理后保存在 ETCD 中。\n而计算节点上最核心的部分，则是一个叫作 kubelet 的组件。\n在 Kubernetes 项目中，kubelet 主要负责同容器运行时(比如 Docker 项目)打交道。而这个交互所依赖的，是一个称作 CRI(Container Runtime Interface) 的远程调用接口，这个接口定义了容器运行时的各项核心操作，比如: 启动一个容器需要的所有参数。\n这也是为何，Kubernetes 项目并不关心你部署的是什么容器运行时、使用的什么技术实现，只要你的这个容器运行时能够运行标准的容器镜像，它就可以通过实现 CRI 接入到 Kubernetes 项目当中。\n而具体的容器运行时，比如 Docker 项目，则一般通过 OCI 这个容器运行时规范同底层的 Linux 操作系统进行交互，即: 把 CRI 请求翻译成对 Linux 操作系统的调用(操作 Linux Namespace 和 Cgroups 等)。\n此外，kubelet 还通过 gRPC 协议同一个叫作 Device Plugin 的插件进行交互。这个插件，是 Kubernetes 项目用来管理 GPU 等宿主机物理设备的主要组件，也是基于 Kubernetes 项目进行机器学习训练、高性能作业支持等工作必须关注的功能。\n而 kubelet 的另一个重要功能，则是调用网络插件和存储插件为容器配置网络和持久化存储。这两个插件与 kubelet 进行交互的接口，分别是 CNI(Container Networking Interface)和 CSI(Container Storage Interface)。\n实际上，kubelet 这个奇怪的名字，来自于 Borg 项目里的同源组件 Borglet。不过，如果你浏览过 Borg 论文的话，就会发现，这个命名方式可能是 kubelet 组件与 Borglet 组件的唯一相似之处。因为 Borg 项目，并不支持我们这里所讲的容器技术，而只是简单地使用了 Linux Cgroups 对进程进行限制。\n这就意味着，像 Docker 这样的“容器镜像”在 Borg 中是不存在的，Borglet 组件也自然不需要像 kubelet 这样考虑如何同 Docker 进行交互、如何对容器镜像进行管理的问题，也不需要支持 CRI、CNI、CSI 等诸多容器技术接口。\n可以说，kubelet 完全就是为了实现 Kubernetes 项目对容器的管理能力而重新实现的一个组件，与 Borg 之间并没有直接的传承关系。\n那么，Borg 对于 Kubernetes 项目的指导作用又体现在哪里呢？\n答案是，Master 节点。\n虽然在 Master 节点的实现细节上 Borg 项目与 Kubernetes 项目不尽相同，但它们的出发点却高度一致，即: 如何编排、管理、调度用户提交的作业。\n所以，Borg 项目完全可以把 Docker 镜像看作一种新的应用打包方式。这样，Borg 团队过去在大规模作业管理与编排上的经验就可以直接 套 在 Kubernetes 项目上了。\n这些经验最主要的表现就是，从一开始，Kubernetes 项目就没有像同时期的各种 容器云 项目那样，把 Docker 作为整个架构的核心，而仅仅把它作为最底层的一个容器运行时实现。\n而 Kubernetes 项目要着重解决的问题，则来自于 Borg 的研究人员在论文中提到的一个非常重要的观点:\n\n运行在大规模集群中的各种任务之间，实际上存在着各种各样的关系。这些关系的处理，才是作业编排和管理系统最困难的地方。\n\n事实也正是如此。\n其实，这种任务与任务之间的关系，在我们平常的各种技术场景中随处可见。比如，一个 Web 应用与数据库之间的访问关系，一个负载均衡器和它的后端服务之间的代理关系，一个门户应用与授权组件之间的调用关系。\n更进一步地说，同属于一个服务单位的不同功能之间，也完全可能存在这样的关系。比如，一个 Web 应用与日志搜集组件之间的文件交换关系。\n而在容器技术普及之前，传统虚拟机环境对这种关系的处理方法都是比较“粗粒度”的。你会经常发现很多功能并不相关的应用被一股脑儿地部署在同一台虚拟机中，只是因为它们之间偶尔会互相发起几个 HTTP 请求。\n更常见的情况则是，一个应用被部署在虚拟机里之后，你还得手动维护很多跟它协作的守护进程 (Daemon)，用来处理它的日志搜集、灾难恢复、数据备份等辅助工作。\n但容器技术出现以后，你就不难发现，在 功能单位 的划分上，容器有着独一无二的 细粒度 优势: 毕竟容器的本质，只是一个进程而已。\n也就是说，只要你愿意，那些原先拥挤在同一个虚拟机里的各个应用、组件、守护进程，都可以被分别做成镜像，然后运行在一个个专属的容器中。它们之间互不干涉，拥有各自的资源配额，可以被调度在整个集群里的任何一台机器上。而这，正是一个 PaaS 系统最理想的工作状态，也是所谓“微服务”思想得以落地的先决条件。\n当然，如果只做到 封装微服务、调度单容器 这一层次，Docker Swarm 项目就已经绰绰有余了。如果再加上 Compose 项目，你甚至还具备了处理一些简单依赖关系的能力，比如：一个 Web 容器 和它要访问的数据库 DB 容器。\n在 Compose 项目中，你可以为这样的两个容器定义一个 link，而 Docker 项目则会负责维护这个 link 关系，其具体做法是: Docker 会在 Web 容器中，将 DB 容器的 IP 地址、端口等信息以环境变量的方式注入进去，供应用进程使用，比如:\nDB_NAME=/web/db\nDB_PORT=tcp://172.17.0.5:5432\nDB_PORT_5432_TCP=tcp://172.17.0.5:5432\nDB_PORT_5432_TCP_PROTO=tcp\nDB_PORT_5432_TCP_PORT=5432\nDB_PORT_5432_TCP_ADDR=172.17.0.5\n\n而当 DB 容器发生变化时(比如，镜像更新，被迁移到其他宿主机上等等)，这些环境变量的值会由 Docker 项目自动更新。这就是平台项目自动地处理容器间关系的典型例子。\n可是，如果我们现在的需求是，要求这个项目能够处理前面提到的所有类型的关系，甚至还要能够支持未来可能出现的更多种类的关系呢？\n这时，link 这种单独针对一种案例设计的解决方案就太过简单了。如果你做过架构方面的工作，就会深有感触：一旦要追求项目的普适性，那就一定要从顶层开始做好设计。\n所以，Kubernetes 项目最主要的设计思想是，从更宏观的角度，以统一的方式来定义任务之间的各种关系，并且为将来支持更多种类的关系留有余地。\n比如，Kubernetes 项目对容器间的 访问 进行了分类，首先总结出了一类非常常见的“紧密交互”的关系，即：这些应用之间需要非常频繁的交互和访问；又或者，它们会直接通过本地文件进行信息交换。\n在常规环境下，这些应用往往会被直接部署在同一台机器上，通过 Localhost 通信，通过本地磁盘目录交换文件。而在 Kubernetes 项目中，这些容器则会被划分为一个 Pod，Pod 里的容器共享同一个 Network Namespace、同一组数据卷，从而达到高效率交换信息的目的。\nPod 是 Kubernetes 项目中最基础的一个对象，源自于 Google Borg 论文中一个名叫 Alloc 的设计。在后续的章节中，我们会对 Pod 做更进一步地阐述。\n而对于另外一种更为常见的需求，比如 Web 应用 与 数据库 之间的访问关系，Kubernetes 项目则提供了一种叫作“Service”的服务。像这样的两个应用，往往故意不部署在同一台机器上，这样即使 Web 应用所在的机器宕机了，数据库也完全不受影响。可是，我们知道，对于一个容器来说，它的 IP 地址等信息不是固定的，那么 Web 应用又怎么找到数据库容器的 Pod 呢？\n所以，Kubernetes 项目的做法是给 Pod 绑定一个 Service 服务，而 Service 服务声明的 IP 地址等信息是 终生不变 的。这个 Service 服务的主要作用，就是作为 Pod 的代理入口 (Portal)，从而代替 Pod 对外暴露一个固定的网络地址。\n这样，对于 Web 应用的 Pod 来说，它需要关心的就是数据库 Pod 的 Service 信息。不难想象，Service 后端真正代理的 Pod 的 IP 地址、端口等信息的自动更新、维护，则是 Kubernetes 项目的职责。\n像这样，围绕着容器和 Pod 不断向真实的技术场景扩展，我们就能够摸索出一幅如下所示的 Kubernetes 项目核心功能的“全景图”。\n\n按照这幅图的线索，我们从容器这个最基础的概念出发，首先遇到了容器间“紧密协作”关系的难题，于是就扩展到了 Pod: 有了 Pod 之后，我们希望能一次启动多个应用的实例，这样就需要 Deployment 这个 Pod 的多实例管理器；而有了这样一组相同的 Pod 后，我们又需要通过一个固定的 IP 地址和端口以负载均衡的方式访问它，于是就有了 Service。\n可是，如果现在两个不同 Pod 之间不仅有“访问关系”，还要求在发起时加上授权信息。最典型的例子就是 Web 应用对数据库访问时需要 Credential(数据库的用户名和密码)信息。那么，在 Kubernetes 中这样的关系又如何处理呢？\nKubernetes 项目提供了一种叫作 Secret 的对象，它其实是一个保存在 Etcd 里的键值对数据。这样，你把 Credential 信息以 Secret 的方式存在 Etcd 里，Kubernetes 就会在你指定的 Pod(比如，Web 应用的 Pod)启动时，自动把 Secret 里的数据以 Volume 的方式挂载到容器里。这样，这个 Web 应用就可以访问数据库了。\n除了应用与应用之间的关系外，应用运行的形态是影响 如何容器化这个应用 的第二个重要因素。\n为此，Kubernetes 定义了新的、基于 Pod 改进后的对象。比如 Job，用来描述一次性运行的 Pod(比如，大数据任务): 再比如 DaemonSet，用来描述每个宿主机上必须且只能运行一个副本的守护进程服务: 又比如 CronJob，则用于描述定时任务等等。\n如此种种，正是 Kubernetes 项目定义容器间关系和形态的主要方法。\n可以看到，Kubernetes 项目并没有像其他项目那样，为每一个管理功能创建一个指令，然后在项目中实现其中的逻辑。这种做法，的确可以解决当前的问题，但是在更多的问题来临之后，往往会力不从心。\n相比之下，在 Kubernetes 项目中，我们所推崇的使用方法是：\n\n首先，通过一个 编排对象，比如 Pod、Job、CronJob 等，来描述你试图管理的应用；\n然后，再为它定义一些“服务对象”，比如 Service、Secret、Horizontal Pod Autoscaler(自动水平扩展器)等。这些对象，会负责具体的平台级功能。\n\n这种使用方法，就是所谓的 声明式 API 。这种 API 对应的 编排对象 和 服务对象，都是 Kubernetes 项目中的 API 对象(API Object)。\n这就是 Kubernetes 最核心的设计理念，也是接下来我会重点剖析的关键技术点。\n最后，我来回答一个更直接的问题: Kubernetes 项目如何启动一个容器化任务呢？\n比如，我现在已经制作好了一个 Nginx 容器镜像，希望让平台帮我启动这个镜像。并且，我要求平台帮我运行两个完全相同的 Nginx 副本，以负载均衡的方式共同对外提供服务。\n如果是自己 DIY 的话，可能需要启动两台虚拟机，分别安装两个 Nginx，然后使用 keepalived 为这两个虚拟机做一个虚拟 IP。\n而如果使用 Kubernetes 项目呢？你需要做的则是编写如下这样一个 YAML 文件(比如名叫 nginx-deployment.yaml):\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: nginx-deployment\n  labels:\n    app: nginx\nspec:\n  replicas: 2\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: nginx\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: nginx\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: nginx\n        image: nginx:1.7.9\n        ports:\n        - containerPort: 80\n\n在上面这个 YAML 文件中，我们定义了一个 Deployment 对象，它的主体部分 (spec.template 部分) 是一个使用 Nginx 镜像的 Pod，而这个 Pod 的副本数是 2(replicas=2)。\n然后执行:\nkubectl create -f nginx-deployment.yaml\n\n这样，两个完全相同的 Nginx 容器副本就被启动了。\n不过，这么看来，做同样一件事情，Kubernetes 用户要做的工作也不少嘛。\n别急，在后续的讲解中，我会陆续介绍 Kubernetes 项目这种 声明式 API 的种种好处，以及基于它实现的强大的编排能力。\n总结\nKubernetes 项目的本质，是为用户提供一个具有普遍意义的容器编排工具。\n参考阅读\n\nThe Google Stack\n\n","id":"https://blog.kiyoko.io/container-orchestration-and-kubernetes/","title":"容器编排与

(adapter)。在个人计算机上，常见的设备控制器要么是直接在母板上的芯片，要么是可插入扩展插槽的印刷电路板。\n机械组件其实就是设备本身。\n下图为这种模块化的设计的简易示意图。\n\n控制器卡上有一些连接器，用途是允许通过线缆连接到设备上，大部分控制器卡支持两个，四个甚至八个设备。控制器和设备之间的接口可以是标准接口，比如 ANSI，IEEE 或 ISO 标准，也可以是事实上的标准，例如，SATA，SCSI，USB，Thunderbolt 或 FireWire(IEEE 1394)。\n控制器和设备之间的接口属于非常底层的接口。例如，磁盘可能被格式化为2,000,000 个扇区，每个磁道 512 字节。但是，实际上从驱动器中出来的是一个串行位流，始于前导码 (preamble)，然后是一个扇区中的 4096 位，最后是一个校验和或纠错码 (ECC)。格式化磁盘后，将写入包含柱面号和扇区号，扇区大小，类似数据以及同步信息的前导码。\n控制器的职责是将串行位流转换为字节块，并执行必要的纠错。首先，控制器在其内部缓冲区中，逐位组装成字节块。在确认校验和无误，且该块无错误后，可以将数据块复制到主存储器中。\nLCD 显示器的控制器在低电平时，可以用作位串行设备。它从存储器中读取包含要显示的字符的字节后，生成修改相应像素背光偏振的信号，实现将字符写入到屏幕上。试想，如果没有显示控制器，则需要操作系统开发者通过显式编程的方式，控制所有像素的电场，这将是一件多么可怕的事情。正是因为使用了控制器，操作系统只需通过少量参数来初始化控制器，例如每行的字符数，像素数以及每屏的行数，之后就可以让控制器来负责实际驱动电场。\n","id":"https://blog.kiyoko.io/device-controllers/","title":"设备控制器"},"https://blog.kiyoko.io/docker-container-exitcode-137-without-oomkilled-flag-set/":{"body":"又是一次喜闻乐见的容器

则通过 Mount Namespace 与 UnionFS 技术，成功的解决了这个问题。\nMount Namespace\n$ man mount_namespace\nMOUNT_NAMESPACES(7)                 Linux Programmer's Manual                 MOUNT_NAMESPACES(7)\n\nNAME\n       mount_namespaces - overview of Linux mount namespaces\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       For an overview of namespaces, see namespaces(7).\n\n       Mount namespaces provide isolation of the list of mount points seen by the processes in each\n       namespace instance. Thus, the processes in each of the mount namespace instances will see\n       distinct single-directory hierarchies.\n\n       The views provided by the /proc/[pid]/mounts, /proc/[pid]/mountinfo, and /proc/[pid]/mountstats\n       files (all described in proc(5)) correspond to the mount namespace in which the process with\n       the PID [pid] resides. (All of the processes that reside in the same mount namespace will see\n       the same view in these files.)\n\n       A new mount namespace is created using either clone(2) or unshare(2) with the CLONE_NEWNS flag.\n       When a new mount namespace is created, its mount point list is initialized as follows:\n\n       * If the namespace is created using clone(2), the mount point list of the child's namespace is\n         a copy of the mount point list in the parent's namespace.\n\n       * If the namespace is created using unshare(2), the mount point list of the new namespace is a\n         copy of the mount point list in the caller's previous mount namespace.\n\n       Subsequent modifications to the mount point list (mount(2) and umount(2)) in either mount\n       namespace will not (by default) affect the mount point list seen in the other namespace (but\n       see the following discussion of shared subtrees).\n\n简单来说，Mount Namepace 为进程提供独立的文件系统视图，即可以将进程的文件系统挂载到指定挂载点，从而是进程只能看到 Mount Namespace 中的文件系统。\n接下来，还是通过代码展示。\nMount Namespace 开发\n下面的代码，使用 Mount Namespace 的方式通过 clone(2) 系统调用，创建一个新的进程。在该进程中执行 /bin/bash 程序。\n#define _GNU_SOURCE\n\n#include &lt;sys/mount.h&gt;\n#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;\n#include &lt;sys/wait.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;sched.h&gt;\n#include &lt;signal.h&gt;\n#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;\n\n#define STACK_SIZE (1024 * 1024)\n\nstatic char container_stack[STACK_SIZE];\n\nchar *const container_args[] = {\n        \"/bin/bash\",\n        NULL\n};\n\nint container_main(void *arg) {\n    printf(\"Container - inside the container!\\n\");\n    execv(container_args[0], container_args);\n    printf(\"Something's wrong!\\n\");\n    return 1;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    printf(\"Parent - start a container!\\n\");\n    int container_pid = clone(container_main, container_stack + STACK_SIZE, CLONE_NEWNS | SIGCHLD, NULL);\n    if (container_pid &lt;

sudo ./mn\nParent - start a container!\nContainer - inside the container!\n[root@zephyrus 01-mount-namespace]#\n\n如此，就成功的进入到了容器环境内。\n注意: 是要使用 root 权限执行这个程序。\n然后，在容器内执行 df -h 指令:\n[root@zephyrus 01-mount-namespace]# df -h\nFilesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sdd        251G   39G  200G  17% /\ntools           931G  362G  570G  39% /init\nnone            2.0G     0  2.0G   0% /dev\ntmpfs           2.0G     0  2.0G   0% /sys/fs/cgroup\nnone            2.0G  8.0K  2.0G   1% /run\nnone            2.0G     0  2.0G   0% /run/lock\nnone            2.0G     0  2.0G   0% /run/shm\nnone            2.0G     0  2.0G   0% /run/user\ntmpfs           2.0G     0  2.0G   0% /mnt/wsl\n/dev/sdc        251G   11G  228G   5% /mnt/wsl/docker-desktop-data/isocache\nnone            2.0G   12K  2.0G   1% /mnt/wsl/docker-desktop/shared-sockets/host-services\n/dev/sdb        251G  117M  239G   1% /mnt/wsl/docker-desktop/docker-desktop-proxy\n/dev/loop0      231M  231M     0 100% /mnt/wsl/docker-desktop/cli-tools\nC:\\             931G  362G  570G  39% /mnt/c\n\n会发现，解决与在宿主机上执行该命令的结果是相同的。这个结果很不好，甚至可以说很危险。因为，不但容器可以看到宿主机上的文件，甚至于还拥有 root 权限。接下来，尝试通过在容器中设置挂载点的方式解决这个问题。\nMount Namespace 指定挂载点\n修改 container_main 函数:\nint container_main(void *arg) {\n    printf(\"Container - inside the container!\\n\");\n    mount(\"none\", \"/tmp\", \"tmpfs\", 0, \"\");\n    execv(container_args[0], container_args);\n    printf(\"Something's wrong!\\n\");\n    return 1;\n}\n\n使用 mount(2) 系统调用，在容器进程中，增加一个挂载点。\n使用 ls 指令确认 /tmp 目录为空目录，说明挂载成功:\nls /tmp\n\n之后，在确认一下系统的文件系统:\n# 在原来的文件系统基础之上会多出一个\n[root@zephyrus 01-mount-namespace]# df -h\nFilesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\nnone            2.0G     0  2.0G   0% /tmp\n\n[root@zephyrus 01-mount-namespace]# mount -l | grep tmpfs\nnone on /tmp type tmpfs (rw,relatime)\n\n这些都可以说明，已经成功在容器内挂载了一个文件系统。而且，在宿主机上是无法看到这个挂载点的。到目前为止，一切都是按照预期发展的。\nMount Namespace 挂载根目录\n既然可以在容器内部挂载 /tmp，那么现在来尝试挂载 /。\n首先，准备一下必要的环境:\n\nbash: 作为容器的第一个进程，允许在容器执行其他指令\nls: 观察容器内的文件系统是否符合预期\nlib: 存放 bash 与 ls 必须的动态链接库\n\n#/bin/bash\n\nT=root\nmkdir -p ${T}/{bin,etc,lib,usr}\ncp -v /bin/{bash,ls} ${T}/bin\ncp -v /etc/profile ${T}/etc/profile\n\nlist=$(ldd /bin/ls | egrep -o '/lib.*\\.[0-9]')\nfor i in $(echo $list | awk -F '\\n' '{print $1}'); do\n  mkdir -p $(dirname \"${T}${i}\") &amp;&amp; cp -v \"$i\" \"${T}${i}\";\ndone\n\nlist=$(ldd /bin/bash | egrep -o '/lib.*\\.[0-9]')\nfor i in $(echo $list | awk -F '\\n' '{print $1}'); do\n  mkdir -p $(dirname \"${T}${i}\") &amp;&amp; cp -v \"$i\" \"${T}${i}\";\ndone\n\n与上一个实验不同的是，现在期望容器内的文件系统与宿主机独立。即，使用不同的根目录。因此，在代码层面需要将之前的 mount(2) 系统调用，改变为 chroot(2) 系统调用。\n$ man 2 chroot\nCHROOT(2)                           Linux Programmer's Manual                           CHROOT(2)\n\nNAME\n       chroot - change root directory\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;\n\n       int chroot(const char *path);\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       chroot() changes the root directory of the calling process to that specified in path. This\n       directory will be used for pathnames beginning with /. The root directory is inherited by\n       all children of the calling process.\n\n       Only a privileged process (Linux: one with the CAP_SYS_CHROOT capability in its user namespace)\n       may call chroot().\n\n最终，函数 container_main 的代码为:\nint container_main(void *arg) {\n    printf(\"Container - inside the container!\\n\");\n    int rev = chroot(\"./root\");\n    if (0 != rev) {\n        perror(\"failed to chroot\");\n        return 2;\n    }\n    rev = chdir(\"/\");\n    if (0 != rev) {\n        perror(\"failed to chdir\");\n        return 3;\n    }\n    rev = execv(container_args[0], container_args);\n    if (0 != rev) {\n        perror(\"failed to exec\");\n        return 5;\n    }\n    printf(\"Something's wrong!\\n\");\n    return 1;\n}\n\n与之前一样，编译并执行程序，即可进入到容器内部:\n$ gcc main.c -o mn; sudo ./mn\nParent - start a container!\nContainer - inside the container!\nbash-4.4#\n\n然后，执行 ls 可以看到根目录 / 的文件就是之前在 root 目录预先准备好的文件:\nbash-4.4# ls /\nbin  etc  lib  lib64  usr\nbash-4.4# ls /bin\nbash  ls\nbash-4.4#\n\n综上所述，如果在 root 目录中保存的是一个完成的操作系统，那么，就可以实现容器内的进程就可以使用内部的 /bin，/lib 的系统环境，从而与宿主机，与其他容器相互隔离的目的。\n备注\n挂载 tmpfs 实验的运行环境为:\n$ cat

uname -r\n4.15.0-112-generic\n\nUnionFS\n在 Cloud Foundry 时代，上云过程繁琐的根本原因在于: 本地环境与云主机环境不一致。\n在狭义上，软件的依赖指编程时所使用的第三方库；广义上，依赖不止包括编程使用的第三方库，操作系统同样也是软件的依赖。\n通过上面对 Mount Namespace 技术简单的实验，已经验证了在容器内打包一个完整的操作系统作为容器的 rootfs 是可行的。到目前为止，从技术的角度而言，已经解决了容器隔离的问题。但从使用角度，或者说用户体验的角度而言，每次构建一个容器，都要打包一份操作系统文件，似乎实在是不便于使用。\n比如，开发者使用 Ubuntu 操作系统的 ISO 制作了一个 rootfs，并依次为基础，安装 Java 环境，进而部署 Java 应用。如果，另一个开发者也有同样的需求，或者同一开发者需要部署另一个 Java 应用，显然，最理想情况是能够复用之前已经安装了 Java 的 rootfs 环境，而不是重复一遍流程。\n直观的解决办法，构建 rootfs 时，每执行一个有意义的操作之后，都生成一个新的 rootfs。之后，就可以选择一个合适的 rootfs 作为基础，添加新的操作构建目标 rootfs。\n但这个方案并不完美，如果每次构建过程都产生一个新的 rootfs，最后将会导致系统内有极其多的 rootfs。\n幸运的是，这个问题并不难解决。将问题一般化，基于既有 A，每一种操作 F 都可以产生唯一结果 B。并且，B 可以作为下一轮的输入。结果发现，这像极了 git 和区块链。\nDocker 在设计 Docker 镜像时也是使用了类似的方法。他们引入了层 (layer) 概念。用户制作镜像的每一步操作，都会生成一个层，将 rootfs 从全量保存，改为了增量保存。\n什么是 UnionFS\nDocker 镜像的这种实现方式，依赖于一种叫做 UnionFS 的文件系统。\n简单来讲，UnionFS 允许将多个设备文件或目录挂载到同一个目录上，将多个设备的内容作为整体对外展示，或者将一个设备文件挂载到一个已有的目录上。\n比如，在 Ubuntu 18.04 上:\n# 准备测试目录\n$ mkdir -p A/{a,x}\n$ mkdir -p B/{b,x}\n$ rm -rf C &amp;&amp; mkdir -p C\n\n使用联合挂载的方式，将这两个目录挂载到一个公共的目录 C 上:\nsudo mount -t aufs -o dirs=./A:./B none ./C\n\n这时可以看到目录 A 与目录 B 被合并到了目录 C 中\n$ tree C\nC\n├── a\n├── b\n└── x\n\n3 directories, 0 files\n\n此时，如果修改 C 也会反应到对应的 A 或 B 中。\nDocker 支持多种存储驱动，但目前默认使用的驱动为 overlay2。\nOverlay2\n接下来通过一个例子来探索 overlay2。\n首先，启动一个容器:\ndocker run -d ubuntu:latest sleep 3600000\n\n这个命令的含义是，使用 ubuntu:latest 这个 Docker 镜像来运行一个容器。然后，使用命令查看镜像的细节:\n$ docker image inspect ubuntu:latest\n...\n        \"GraphDriver\": {\n            \"Data\": {\n

layer。为了解决空间，提高效率等目的， Docker 构建镜像时，使用了 COW 技术，即 layer 在 image 之间是被共享的。一个 Image 是由多个有先后逻辑顺序的 Layer 所构成，也就是 RootFS 中的 Layer ，上面是底层，下面是顶层。这个信息保存在

的所有 rootfs 都保存在 /var/lib/docker/overlay2 中，具体到上面的 layer: e1c75a5e0bfa094c407e411eb6cc8a159ee8b060cbd0398f1693978b4af9af10 的 rootfs 的位置就是

做法是，在修改了这些文件之后，以一个单独的层挂载了出来。而用户执行 docker commit 只会提交可读写层，所以是不包含这些内容的。\n最终，这几个层都被联合挂载，表现为一个完整的 Ubuntu 操作系统供容器使用。\n总结\nMount Namespace 技术为容器提供了独立 rootfs 的能力，使容器在本地环境，测试环境，云环境之间具备了真正的 一致性。\nUnionFS 为

VDI基础设施。在消费市场上，GPU多用于加速游戏图形。如今，GPGPU(General Purpose GPU) 是现代高性能计算 (HPC) 场景中加速计算的普遍硬件选择。\n会用到 GPU 的领域除了我们熟悉的 HPC，比如会用到图像识别的机器学习方向，也常用在医疗、保险和金融行业相关的垂直领域中使用的 表格数据 (Tabular Data) 的计算。\n因此，就引出一个问题: 为什么需要使用 GPU 而不是 CPU?\n延迟与吞吐量\n首先，来看看 CPU 和 GPU 的主要区别。\nCPU 对速度与延迟方面进行了优化，在保持操作之间快速切换的能力的前提下，以尽可能低的延迟完成任务。它的本质就是以序列化的方式处理任务。\nGPU 对吞吐量方面进行了优化，它允许一次推尽可能多的任务到内部，并通过并行方式处理每个任务。\n下面的示例图显示了 CPU 和 GPU 核心 的数量。显而易见地，GPU 具有更多的核心来处理一个任务。\n\n异同点\n然而，这不仅仅是核心数量的问题。而当我们说到NVIDIA GPU中的核心时，我们指的是由ALU（算术逻辑单元）组成的CUDA核心。不同厂商的术语可能会有所不同。\n从CPU和GPU的整体架构来看，我们可以看到两者之间有很多相似之处。两者都使用了缓存层、内存控制器和全局内存的内存构造。对现代CPU架构的高层概述表明，它都是通过使用重要的缓存内存层来实现低延迟的内存访问。让我们先看一张图，它显示了一个通用的、以内存为中心的现代CPU封装（注意：精确的布局强烈地取决于供应商/型号）。\n\n一个CPU包由核心组成，包含独立的数据层和指令层-1缓存，由层-2缓存支持。第3层高速缓存，也就是最后一层高速缓存，由多个核心共享。如果数据没有驻留在缓存层中，它将从全局DDR-4内存中获取数据。每个CPU的核心数量可以达到28个或32个，根据品牌和型号的不同，在Turbo模式下可以运行到2.5GHz或3.8GHz。缓存大小范围为每个核心最高2MB二级缓存。\n探索GPU架构\n如果我们检查GPU的高层架构概述（同样，强烈依赖make/model），看起来GPU的本质就是把可用的核心投入工作，它不太注重低延迟的缓存内存访问。\n\n单个GPU设备由多个处理器集群（PC）组成，其中包含多个流式多处理器（SM）。每个SM容纳一个第1层指令缓存层与其相关的核心。通常情况下，一个SM在从全局GDDR-5内存中提取数据之前，会使用一个专用的第1层缓存和一个共享的第2层缓存。其架构对内存延迟的容忍度很高。\n与CPU相比，GPU工作的内存缓存层数较少，而且相对较小。原因是GPU有更多的晶体管用于计算，这意味着它不太在乎从内存中检索数据所需的时间。只要GPU手头有足够的计算量，潜在的内存访问 \"延迟 \"就会被掩盖，使其保持忙碌。\n\nA GPU is optimized for data parallel throughput computations.\n\n从核心数量来看，它很快就能让你看到它在并行方面的可能性。 当检查当前NVIDIA的旗舰产品Tesla V100时，一台设备包含80个SM，每个SM包含64个核心，总共有5120个核心！任务不是安排给单个核心，而是安排给处理器集群和SM。任务不是安排给单个核心，而是安排给处理器集群和SM。这就是它能够并行处理的原因。现在把这个强大的硬件设备和编程框架结合起来，应用就可以充分发挥GPU的计算能力。\n参考资料\n\nExploring the GPU

(Record Layer) 和传输层，记录层协议确定传输层数据的封装格式。传输层安全协议使用 X.509 认证，然后利用非对称加密演算来对通信方做身份认证，之后交换对称密钥作为会谈密钥 (Session key)。这个会谈密钥是用来将通信两方交换的数据做加密，保证两个应用间通信的保密性和可靠性，使客户与服务器应用之间的通信不被攻击者窃听。\nHTTPS 协议\n超文本传输安全协议 (HTTPS: HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure，常称为HTTP over TLS、HTTP over SSL或HTTP Secure) 是一种通过计算机网络进行安全通信的传输协议。HTTPS 经由 HTTP 进行通信，但利用 SSL/TLS 来加密数据包。HTTPS 开发的主要目的，是提供对网站服务器的身份认证，保护交换数据的隐私与完整性。\n认证过程\n单向认证\n在访问大多数网站 (google, facebook) 时，会使用单向认证的方式。客户端(浏览器)会验证服务端证书的合法性，过程如下：\n\n\n客户端发起建立 HTTPS 连接请求，将 SSL 协议版本的信息发送给服务器端\n服务器端将本机的公钥证书 (server.crt) 发送给客户端\n客户端读取公钥证书 (server.crt) 取出服务端公钥\n客户端生成随机密钥 R，用服务器公钥加密密钥R，将密文发送给服务端\n服务端用私钥 (server.key) 解密密文，得到了密钥 R\n双方使用随机密钥 R 通信的对称加密密钥\n\n双向认证\n而在某些有较高安全性要求，或需要验证访问者身份的场景，则可能会需要用到双向认证的方式：\n\n\n客户端发起建立 HTTPS 连接请求，将 SSL 协议版本的信息发送给服务端；\n服务器端将本机的公钥证书 (server.crt) 发送给客户端\n客户端读取公钥证书 (server.crt) 取出服务端公钥\n客户端将客户端公钥证书 (client.crt) 发送给服务器端\n服务器端使用根证书 (root.crt) 解密客户端公钥证书，得到客户端公钥\n客户端发送自己支持的加密方案给服务器端\n服务器端根据自己和客户端的能力，选择一个双方都能接受的加密方案，使用客户端的公钥加密目标方案. 后发送给客户端；\n客户端使用自己的私钥解密加密方案，生成随机密钥 R，使用服务器公钥加密后传给服务器端；\n服务端用自己的私钥去解密这个密文，得到了密钥 R\n双方使用随机密钥 R 通信的对称加密密钥\n\n生成自签名证书\n生成这一些列证书之前，我们需要先生成一个 CA 根证书，然后由这个 CA 根证书颁发服务器公钥证书和客户端公钥证书。为了验证根证书颁发与验证客户端证书这个逻辑，我们使用根证书生成两套不同的客户端证书，然后同时用两个客户端证书来发送请求，看服务器端是否都能识别。下面是证书生成的内在逻辑示意图：\n\n生成根证书\n# 创建根证书私钥：\n$ openssl genrsa -out root.key 1024\n\n# 创建根证书请求文件：\n$ openssl req -new -out root.csr -key root.key\n# 后续参数请自行填写，下面是一个例子：\n# Country Name (2 letter code) [XX]:cn\n# State or Province Name (full name) []:bj\n#

CREATE TABLE 语句创建表时，如若未通过 ENGINE 子句指定引擎，将采用 InnoDB 作为默认的存储引擎。\nInnoDB 的关键优势\n\nInnoDB 的 DML 操作遵循 ACID 模型，且具有提交、回滚、错误恢复等事务的功能与能力，保障用户数据安全。\n行级锁定和 Oracle 风格的 一致性读取 提高了多用户使用时的并发性与性能。\nInnoDB 表将数据存放在磁盘上，基于 主键 来优化查询。每个 InnoDB 表都有一个称为 聚集索引 的主键索引，使用该索引组织数据可以将查找主键的 I/O 最小化。\n为了维护数据完整性，InnoDB 支持外键约束。当使用外键时，InnoDB 会检查插入、更新和删除等语句，来确保它们不会导致相关表之间的数据不一致。\n\nInnoDB 功能列表\nFeatureSupport\nB-tree indexesYes\nBackup/point-in-time recovery (在服务端实现，而非存储引擎。)Yes\nCluster database supportNo\nClustered indexesYes\nCompressed dataYes\nData cachesYes\nEncrypted dataYes (在服务器端通过加密功能实现;在MySQL 5.7和更高版本中，支持数据静止加密。)\nForeign key supportYes\nFull-text search indexesYes (在MySQL 5.6和更高版本中支持全文索引。)\nGeospatial data type supportYes\nGeospatial indexing supportYes (MySQL 5.7和更高版本中提供了对地理空间索引的支持。)\nHash indexesNo (InnoDB内部利用哈希索引来实现自适应哈希索引特性。)\nIndex cachesYes\nLocking granularityRow\nMVCCYes\nReplication support (在服务端实现，而非存储引擎。)Yes\nStorage limits64TB\nT-tree indexesNo\nTransactionsYes\nUpdate statistics for data dictionaryYes\n\n使用 InnoDB 的优势\n使用 InnoDB 有如下优势:\n\n如果服务器由于硬件或软件问题而意外退出，无论崩溃时数据库内部遇到什么问题，在重新启动数据库后都不需要做任何特殊的操作。InnoDB 会恢复崩溃前已经确定的更改，并撤销正在进行但未提交的更改，允许用户重新启动并从停止的地方继续。\nInnoDB 存储引擎维护其内部的缓冲池，当数据被访问时，该缓冲池会在内存中缓存表和索引数据。频繁被使用到的数据将直接从内存中处理。多种类型的信息都可以通过使用该缓存来提高处理速度。在专用的数据库服务器上，通常会将高达 80% 的物理内存分配给缓冲池使用。\n可以设置外键，保证多个相关数据表之间的数据完整性。\n如果磁盘或内存中的数据损坏，校验和 机制会在使问题假数据之前向用户发出警告。变量 innodb_checksum_algorithm 定义了 InnoDB 使用了何种校验和算法。\n在 WHERE、ORDER BY、GROUP BY 等子句与 JOIN 操作中使用主键时，InnoDB 将自动优化涉及这些列的操作，使这些操作的执行速度非常快。\n更改缓冲(change buffering) 这一自动极致会对插入，更新和删除进行优化。 InnoDB 不仅允许对同一表的并发读写访问，而且会缓存被更改数据，使磁盘 I/O 流水线化。\n性能优势并不仅限于哪些需要很长时间查询的大表。当表中的某些被反复访问时，InnoDB 会通过自适应哈希索引( Adaptive Hash Index) 处理，加快查询速度，达到类似使用哈希表查找的效果。\n允许压缩表和关联索引。\n加密数据。\n在线创建和删除索引，执行其他 DDL 操作对性能和可用性有较小的影响。\n截断每个表文件的表空间的速度非常快，被释放的磁盘空间不仅可以供 InnoDB 使用，操作系统同样可以重用。\n表数据的存储布局对于使用动态(DYNAMIC) 行格式的 BLOB 和长文本字段更有效。\n可以通过查询 INFORMATION_SCHEMA 表来监视存储引擎的内部工作。\n可以通过查询 performance_schema 表来监控存储引擎的性能详情。\n可以混合使用 InnoDB 表和使用其他 MySQL 存储引擎的表，即使是在同一个语句中。例如，可以使用 JOIN 操作在单个查询中组合来自 InnoDB 和内存表的数据。\nInnoDB 的设计目标是在处理大数据量时的提高 CPU 效率并达到最高性能。\nInnoDB 表可以处理大量数据，即使在文件大小被限制为 2GB 的操作系统上。\n\nInnoDB 表的最佳实践\n在使用 InnoDB 的表时有如下最佳实践:\n\n使用查询最频繁的一列或多列作为表的主键，如果没有明显的主键，则使用自动递增 ID。\n使用 JOIN 操作根据相同的 ID 值从多个表中从多个表中获取数据。在 JOIN 的列上定义外键约束，并为这些列声明相同的数据类型。外键约束可以确保被引用的列上是有索引的，这也可以提高性能。同时，外键约束可以将删除和更新的结果在所有收到影响的表上生效，保证当父表中没有相应的 ID 时，不会将数据插入到子表中。\n关闭自动提交可以提高性能 (受到存储设备写入速度的限制)。\n使用 START TRANSACTION 和 COMMIT 语句，将一组相关的 DML 操作，以事务的形式执行。事务的范围过小会导致频繁提交，范围过大会导致提交间隔太久。\n禁止使用 LOCK TABLES 语句。InnoDB 可以同时处理多个会话对同一个表的读写，而不会牺牲可靠性和高性能。要获得对一组行的独占写访问，请使用 SELECT ... FOR UPDATE 只锁定要更新的行。\n启用变量 innodb_file_per_table，或者使用通用表空间(general tablespaces) 将表的数据和索引放到单独的文件中，不建议使用 system 表空间(system tablespace)。默认启用变量 innodb_file_per_table。\n压缩 InnoDB 表数据，在某些场景可以提升读写性能。\n使用 --sql_mode=NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION 参数启动服务，可避免使用禁止的引擎创建表。\n\n参考资料\n\nIntroduction to InnoDB\nBenefits of Using InnoDB Tables\nBest Practices for InnoDB

100 名学生参加考试，5 名教师阅卷。\n任务并行\n将待解决的问题所需要执行的各个任务分配到各个核心上执行。\n对应到上述问题中，可以认为每个阅卷教师就是一个处理核心，批改每一道题是一个任务。则将任务分配到核心的含义是: 每一名教师只需要负责批阅固定的一道题目。\n数据并行\n将待解决问题所需要处理的数据分配给各个处理核心，每个处理核心执行相同的操作。\n对应到上述问题中，可以认为每个阅卷教师就是一个处理核心，将试卷 —— 也就是数据分配给教师，教师负责试卷的整个批阅过程。各个老师是做的工作是相同的。\n性能\n如何衡量并行程序的性能指标。\n加速比和效率\n","id":"https://blog.kiyoko.io/introduction-to-parallel-programming/","title":"并行程序设计"},"https://blog.kiyoko.io/io-devices/":{"body":"I/O 设备大致可分为两类：块设备和字符设备。\n块设备将信息存储在固定大小的块中。通常情况，数据块的大小在 512 Bytes 到 32768 Bytes 之间。所有传输过程均以块为单位，每次传输一个或多个完整且连续的块。对每个块的读或写操作是互相独立的，这是块设备的基本属性。常见的块设备有硬盘、蓝光光盘等。每个设备块都有各自的地址，因此块设备支持寻址操作，可以使用 seek 指令任意指定偏移位置。比如，磁盘接收到该指令后，通过旋转机械臂及磁头的方式完成寻址操作。\n字符设备在传输数据时使用流式传输的方式，为不可寻址设备，因此也不支持 seek 操作。常见的字符设备有鼠标，网卡等。\n但事实上，这种分类方案并不是完美无缺的。因为，还有一些设备无法适用于这个分类方案。\n比如，时钟是一种按照预定义时间间隔产生中断信息的一种设备，它既不是可寻址的块设备，也不是字符流设备。除此之外，还有内存映射、屏幕、触摸屏等各类设备。但换一个角度分析，由于计算机使用到的大部分 I/O 设备，要么是块设备，要么是字符设备，这个分类模型足够通用。因此，可以用来作为独立于设备的基础操作系统基础模块。例如，文件系统就是用于处理经过抽象处理之后的块设备，而具体到设备层面的交互则交给更底层的软件处理，比如设备驱动程序。\n","id":"https://blog.kiyoko.io/io-devices/","title":"I/O

(aio_系列函数)\n\n一次输入操作通常会包括两个不同的阶段:\n\n等待数据准备好\n将数据从内核复制到进程\n\n而对于一个发生在套接字上的输入操作，第一步是等待数据从网络中到达。当目标分组到达时，数据将被复制到内核中的某个缓冲区。第二步是把数据从内核缓冲区复制到应用进程缓冲区。\n在之后的例子中，以 UDP 为例，并将函数 recvfrom 视为系统调用。\n阻塞式 I/O 模型\n最流行，最常用的 I/O 模型当属阻塞式 I/O (blocking I/O) 模型。并且，在默认情况下，所有的套接字都是阻塞式的。\n\n非阻塞式 I/O 模型\n当进程将一个套接字设置成非阻塞式后，如果对其进行的 I/O 操作会导致当前进程进入到睡眠状态，内核会直接返回一个错误，避免进程进入到睡眠状态。\n\n上图所示，前三次调用 recvfrom 时均没有已就绪的数据，因此内核立刻返回了错误 EWOULDBLOCK。而当第四次调用 recvfrom 时，已有数据准备就绪，内核此时就会将这部分数据返回给进程。\n当应用进程如上图所示对一个非阻塞的文件描述符循环调用 recvfrom 时，该过程被称作 轮询 (polling)。该过程通常会消耗大量的 CPU 资源。\nI/O 复用模型\n目前主流系统系统了一种叫做 I/O 多路复用 (I/O Multiplexing) 的技术，允许一次监听多个文件描述符。\n\n对比 I/O 多路复用 的处理过程与 阻塞式 I/O 的处理过程，不难发现，阻塞式 I/O 模型的两个阶段均阻塞在 recvfrom 系统调用上，而 I/O 多路复用 模型将第一阶段阻塞在 select 系统调用上，而第二个阶段依然阻塞在 recvfrom 上。\n信号驱动式 I/O 模型\n当内核在文件描述符就绪时发送 SIGIO 信号通知应用进程。\n\n异步 I/O\n应用进程告知内核启动某个操作，并让内核在完成整个操作(包含两个阶段)后通知应用进程。该模型与信号驱动模型的区别在于: 信号驱动式I/O由内核通知应用进程何时可以启动I/O操作，而异步I/O模型是有内核通知应用进程I/O操作何时完成。\n\n参考资料\n\nMAN Page: sigaction\nSIGIO

If the container associated\n// with the exec instance is stopped or paused, it will return an error.\nfunc (daemon *Daemon) getExecConfig(name string) (*exec.Config, error) {\n  ec := daemon.execCommands.Get(name)\n\n  ctr := daemon.containers.Get(ec.ContainerID)\n  // ...\n  return ec, nil\n}\n\nfunc (daemon *Daemon) ContainerExecStart(ctx context.Context, name string, stdin io.Reader, stdout io.Writer, stderr io.Writer) (err error) {\n  ec, _ := daemon.getExecConfig(name)\n  c := daemon.containers.Get(ec.ContainerID)\n  // Synchronize with libcontainerd event loop\n  ec.Lock()\n  c.ExecCommands.Lock()\n  systemPid, err := daemon.containerd.Exec(ctx, c.ID, ec.ID, p, cStdin != nil, ec.InitializeStdio)\n  // the exec context should be ready, or error happened.\n  // close the chan to notify readiness\n  close(ec.Started)\n  if err != nil {\n    c.ExecCommands.Unlock()\n    ec.Unlock()\n    return translateContainerdStartErr(ec.Entrypoint, ec.SetExitCode, err)\n  }\n  ec.Pid = systemPid\n  c.ExecCommands.Unlock()\n  ec.Unlock()\n}\n\n在上面的函数中，通过 name 获取到了一个 ec，通过 ec.ContainerID 获取到了 container，然后对 ec 与 container.ExecCommands 加锁。\n根据调用链可知当前 goroutine 执行进入了 daemon.containerd.Exec，所以执行函数之前锁住的两把锁都没有被释放，那么现在就有一个问题: 锁的粒度有多大？\n为了解决这个疑问，就需要找到锁的源头: name 的来源，因为 name -&gt; ec -&gt; Lock / Container -&gt; Lock。\n回溯调用关系，*Daemon.ContainerExecStart 的调用者是路由回调函数 *containerRouter.postContainerExecStart，*Daemon.ContainerExecStart 的入参 name 是 *containerRouter.postContainerExecStart 的局部变量 execName。近一步回溯，execName 的来源是路由变量 :name，路由如下:\nrouter.NewPostRoute(\"/exec/{name:.*}/start\", r.postContainerExecStart)\n\n为了知道 name 是什么，则需要查看 Docker 的 API 文档。\n首先，通过命令 docker version 可以确定 docker v20.10.3 使用的 API 版本如下:\n$ docker version\nClient: Docker Engine - Community\n Version:           20.10.3\n API version:       1.41\n Go version:        go1.13.15\n Git commit:        48d30b5\n Built:             Fri Jan 29 14:34:14 2021\n OS/Arch:           linux/amd64\n Context:           default\n Experimental:      true\n\nServer: Docker Engine - Community\n Engine:\n  Version:          20.10.3\n  API version:      1.41 (minimum version 1.12)\n  Go version:       go1.13.15\n  Git commit:       46229ca\n  Built:            Fri Jan 29 14:32:37 2021\n  OS/Arch:          linux/amd64\n  Experimental:     false\n containerd:\n  Version:          1.4.3\n  GitCommit:        269548fa27e0089a8b8278fc4fc781d7f65a939b\n nvidia:\n  Version:          1.0.0-rc92\n  GitCommit:        ff819c7e9184c13b7c2607fe6c30ae19403a7aff\n docker-init:\n  Version:          0.19.0\n  GitCommit:        de40ad0\n\n即版本是 API version: 1.41 (minimum version 1.12)。\n通过查阅 Docker API Reference 获取具体的 API:\nPOST /exec/{id}/start\n\n{\n  \"Detach\": false,\n  \"Tty\": false\n}\n\n\nPath Parameters:\n\nid\n\nstring Required\nExec instance ID\n\n\n\n\n易得，API 文档中的 id 就是代码中的 name。\n而 exec id 是通过如下 API 获得(当然，这个属于盲猜，应该可以通过查阅 docker client 的 exec 命令部分的源码就能确定):\nPOST /containers/{id}/exec\n\n{\n  \"AttachStdin\": false,\n  \"AttachStdout\": true,\n  \"AttachStderr\": true,\n  \"DetachKeys\": \"ctrl-p,ctrl-q\",\n  \"Tty\": false,\n  \"Cmd\": [\n    \"date\"\n  ],\n  \"Env\": [\n    \"FOO=bar\",\n    \"BAZ=quux\"\n  ]\n}\n\n\nPath Parameters:\n\nid\n\nstring Required\nID or name of container\n\n\n\n\n因此，可以得出结论，先调用 ContainerExec 通过 container id 获取 exec id，然后使用上面获得的 exec id调用 ExecStart。\n但是，到此为止只是清楚了逻辑关系，还无法解答锁的粒度，或许应该看一下 ContainerExec 的逻辑。\n根据路由信息 router.NewPostRoute(\"/containers/{name:.*}/exec\", r.postContainerExecCreate)，找到 ContainerExec 的处理函数 postContainerExecCreate 中关于 exec id 部分的逻辑:\nfunc (s *containerRouter) postContainerExecCreate(ctx context.Context, w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request, vars map[string]string) error {\n  // ...\n  name := vars[\"name\"]\n\n  execConfig := &amp;types.ExecConfig{}\n  json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(execConfig)\n\n  // Register an instance of Exec in container.\n  id, err := s.backend.ContainerExecCreate(name, execConfig)\n  if err != nil {\n    logrus.Errorf(\"Error setting up exec command in container %s: %v\", name, err)\n    return err\n  }\n\n  return httputils.WriteJSON(w, http.StatusCreated, &amp;types.IDResponse{\n    ID: id,\n  })\n}\n\n// ContainerExecCreate sets up an exec in a running container.\nfunc (daemon *Daemon) ContainerExecCreate(name string, config *types.ExecConfig) (string, error) {\n  // 通过 container name 获取当前处于活跃状态的 container\n  cntr, _ := daemon.getActiveContainer(name)\n\n  cmd := strslice.StrSlice(config.Cmd)\n  entrypoint, args := daemon.getEntrypointAndArgs(strslice.StrSlice{}, cmd)\n\n  keys := []byte{}\n  if config.DetachKeys != \"\" {\n    keys, _ = term.ToBytes(config.DetachKeys)\n  }\n\n  execConfig := exec.NewConfig()\n  execConfig.OpenStdin = config.AttachStdin\n  execConfig.OpenStdout = config.AttachStdout\n  execConfig.OpenStderr = config.AttachStderr\n  // config 的 container id 就是 container.ID 即容器的 ID\n  execConfig.ContainerID = cntr.ID\n  execConfig.DetachKeys = keys\n  execConfig.Entrypoint = entrypoint\n  execConfig.Args = args\n  execConfig.Tty = config.Tty\n  execConfig.Privileged = config.Privileged\n  execConfig.User = config.User\n  execConfig.WorkingDir = config.WorkingDir\n\n  daemon.registerExecCommand(cntr, execConfig)\n\n  return execConfig.ID, nil\n}\n\n// NewConfig initializes the a new exec configuration\nfunc NewConfig() *Config {\n   return &amp;Config{\n      ID:           stringid.GenerateRandomID(),\n      StreamConfig: stream.NewConfig(),\n      Started:      make(chan struct{}),\n   }\n}\n\nfunc (daemon *Daemon) registerExecCommand(container *container.Container, config *exec.Config) {\n  // Storing execs in container in order to kill them gracefully whenever the container is stopped or removed.\n  container.ExecCommands.Add(config.ID, config)\n  // Storing execs in daemon for easy access via Engine API.\n  daemon.execCommands.Add(config.ID, config)\n}\n\n到此为止，逻辑关系就比较清晰了。postContainerExecCreate 的路由参数 name 就是 container id。*Daemon.ContainerExecCreate 内部创建了一个随机的 exec id 保存在 execConfig 中，同时在 execConfig 持有了 container id。所以，对于一个 container 的多次 exec 命令使用不同的 exec id，但他们共同持有相同的 container id。而后调用 *Daemon.registerExecCommand 将 execConfig 以 exec id 作为索引添加到缓存中。\n回到函数 func (daemon *Daemon) ContainerExecStart，通过 exec id 可以获取到不同的 ec 对象，调用 ec.Lock() 的锁粒度为 exec id，对于同一个 container 的多次执行 exec，他们持有的 container id 是相同的，因此 c.ExecCommands.Lock() 的锁粒度是 container 级别。\n综上所述，可以确定当前 goroutine 未释放两把锁资源，会导致之后的 exec 操作是一定会失败的。但阻塞在这里的原因还不清晰。从函数调用栈可以看到当前 goroutine 在等待 gRPC 的响应。\ndaemon.containerd 的类型是接口 github.com/docker/docker/libcontainerd/types.Client，其实现者是位于 docker/libcontainerd/remote/client.go 的 struct client 类型:\ntype client struct {\n  client   *containerd.Client\n  stateDir string\n  logger

无响应"},"https://blog.kiyoko.io/kubernetes-controllers/":{"body":"在机器人技术和自动化领域，控制回路（Control Loop）是一个非终止回路，用于调节系统状态。\n这是一个控制环的例子：房间里的温度自动调节器。\n当你设置了温度，告诉了温度自动调节器你的期望状态（Desired State）。 房间的实际温度是当前状态（Current State）。 通过对设备的开关控制，温度自动调节器让其当前状态接近期望状态。\n控制器通过 apiserver 监控集群的公共状态，并致力于将当前状态转变为期望的状态。\n控制器模式\n一个控制器至少追踪一种类型的 Kubernetes 资源。这些 对象 有一个代表期望状态的 spec 字段。 该资源的控制器负责确保其当前状态接近期望状态。\n控制器可能会自行执行操作；在 Kubernetes 中更常见的是一个控制器会发送信息给 API 服务器，这会有副作用。 具体可参看后文的例子。\n通过 API 服务器来控制\nJob 控制器是一个 Kubernetes 内置控制器的例子。 内置控制器通过和集群 API 服务器交互来管理状态。\nJob 是一种 Kubernetes 资源，它运行一个或者多个 Pod， 来执行一个任务然后停止。 （一旦被调度了，对 kubelet 来说 Pod 对象就会变成了期望状态的一部分）。\n在集群中，当 Job 控制器拿到新任务时，它会保证一组 Node 节点上的 kubelet 可以运行正确数量的 Pod 来完成工作。 Job 控制器不会自己运行任何的 Pod 或者容器。Job 控制器是通知 API 服务器来创建或者移除 Pod。控制面中的其它组件 根据新的消息作出反应（调度并运行新 Pod）并且最终完成工作。\n创建新 Job 后，所期望的状态就是完成这个 Job。Job 控制器会让 Job 的当前状态不断接近期望状态：创建为 Job 要完成工作所需要的 Pod，使 Job 的状态接近完成。\n控制器也会更新配置对象。例如：一旦 Job 的工作完成了，Job 控制器会更新 Job 对象的状态为 Finished。\n（这有点像温度自动调节器关闭了一个灯，以此来告诉你房间的温度现在到你设定的值了）。\n直接控制\n相比 Job 控制器，有些控制器需要对集群外的一些东西进行修改。\n例如，如果你使用一个控制环来保证集群中有足够的节点，那么控制就需要当前集群外的一些服务在需要时创建新节点。\n和外部状态交互的控制器从 API 服务器获取到它想要的状态，然后直接和外部系统进行通信并使当前状态更接近期望状态。\n（实际上有一个控制器可以水平地扩展集群中的节点。请参阅 集群自动扩缩容）。\n设计\n作为设计原则之一，Kubernetes 使用了很多控制器，每个控制器管理集群状态的一个特定方面。 最常见的一个特定的控制器使用一种类型的资源作为它的期望状态， 控制器管理控制另外一种类型的资源向它的期望状态演化。\n使用简单的控制器而不是一组相互连接的单体控制回路是很有用的。 控制器会失败，所以 Kubernetes 的设计正是考虑到了这一点。\n\n说明：\n可以有多个控制器来创建或者更新相同类型的对象。 在后台，Kubernetes 控制器确保它们只关心与其控制资源相关联的资源。\n例如，你可以创建 Deployment 和 Job；它们都可以创建 Pod。 Job 控制器不会删除 Deployment 所创建的 Pod，因为有信息 （标签）让控制器可以区分这些 Pod。\n\n运行控制器的方式\nKubernetes 内置一组控制器，运行在 kube-controller-manager 内。 这些内置的控制器提供了重要的核心功能。\nDeployment 控制器和 Job 控制器是 Kubernetes 内置控制器的典型例子。 Kubernetes 允许你运行一个稳定的控制平面，这样即使某些内置控制器失败了， 控制平面的其他部分会接替它们的工作。\n你会遇到某些控制器运行在控制面之外，用以扩展 Kubernetes。 或者，如果你愿意，你也可以自己编写新控制器。 你可以以一组 Pod 来运行你的控制器，或者运行在 Kubernetes 之外。 最合适的方案取决于控制器所要执行的功能是什么。\n举例说明\n以 Deployment 为例:\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: nginx-deployment\nspec:\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: nginx\n  replicas: 2\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: nginx\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: nginx\n        image: nginx:1.7.9\n        ports:\n        - containerPort: 80\n\n该 Deployment 定义的编排动作要求: 确保携带了 app=nginx 标签的 Pod 的个数，永远等于 spec.replicas 指定的个数，即 2 个。\n集群会根据携带 app=nginx 标签的 Pod 的实际数量来执行创建或者删除 Pod 操作，使数量收敛于 2。\n这时，你也许就会好奇：究竟是 Kubernetes 项目中的哪个组件，在执行这些操作呢？\n在上一小节提到的 kube-controller-manager 就是负责管理 Controllers 的服务组件。并且，Kubernetes 项目已经包含了若干的 Controllers:\n$ cd kubernetes/pkg/controller/\n$ ls -d */\ndeployment/             job/                    podautoscaler/\ncloud/                  disruption/             namespace/\nreplicaset/             serviceaccount/         volume/\ncronjob/                garbagecollector/       nodelifecycle/          replication/            statefulset/            daemon/\n\n控制循环\n正如本文开篇所说，Kubernetes 的 Controllers 遵循 控制回路（Control Loop） 的工作模式。\n比如，对于编排的对象 X，可以用一段 Go 语言风格的伪代码，来描述其 Controller 的控制循环：\nfor {\n    实际状态 := 获取集群中对象X的实际状态（Actual State）\n    期望状态 := 获取集群中对象X的期望状态（Desired State）\n    if 实际状态 == 期望状态{\n        什么都不做\n    } else {\n        执行编排动作，将实际状态调整为期望状态\n    }\n}\n\n一般情况:\n\n实际状态来自于 Kubernetes 集群本身: 比如，kubelet 通过心跳汇报的容器状态和节点状态，或者监控系统中保存的应用监控数据，或者控制器主动收集的它自己感兴趣的信息，这些都是常见的实际状态的来源。\n期望状态来自于用户提交的 YAML 文件: 比如，Deployment 对象中 Replicas 字段的值。很明显，这些信息往往都保存在 Etcd 中。\n\n具体到本示例，Deployment 控制器的工作流程为:\n\n从 Etcd 中获取到所有携带了 app: nginx 标签的 Pod，统计其数量，作为实际状态\n从 Template 中获取 Deployment 对象的 spec.replicas 值，作为期望状态\n将两个状态做比较，然后根据比较结果，确定是创建 Pod，还是删除已有的 Pod\n\n以上即为 Kubernetes Controller 的工作模式。\n参考文档\n\nArchitecture-Controllers\nWorkloads-Controllers\n\n","id":"https://blog.kiyoko.io/kubernetes-controllers/","title":"Kubernetes

framework，允许用户将系统硬件资源发布到 Kubelet。\nDevice Plugin 由设备供应商实现，由用户或手动部署或作为 DaemonSet 来部署，而无需定制 Kubernetes 本身的代码。目标设备可以是 GPU、高性能 NIC、FPGA、InfiniBand 适配器以及其他类似的、可能需要特定于供应商的初始化和设置的计算资源。\n注册 Device Plugin\nkubelet 提供了一个 Registration 的 gRPC 服务:\nservice Registration {\n    rpc Register(RegisterRequest) returns (Empty) {}\n}\n\nDevice Plugin 可以通过此 gRPC 服务在 kubelet 进行注册。在注册时，Device Plugin 需要提供如下内容:\n\nDevice Plugin 的 Unix 套接字。\nDevice Plugin 的 API 版本。\nResourceName。遵循 扩展资源命名方案，形如 vendor-domain/resourcetype: 比如 NVIDIA GPU 就被公布为 nvidia.com/gpu。\n\n在成功注册后，Device Plugin 会向 kubelet 发送他所管理的设备列表，之后 kubelet 负责将这些资源发布到 API Server，作为 kubelet 节点状态更新的一部分。\n比如，Device Plugin 在 kubelet 中注册了 hardware-vendor.example/foo 并报告了节点上的两个运行状况良好的设备后，节点状态将更新以通告该节点已安装2个 Foo 设备并且是可用的。\n然后，用户就可以在 Container 规范中请求这类设备，但是有以下的限制:\n\n扩展资源仅可作为整数资源使用，且不能被过量使用\n设备不能在容器之间共享\n\n假设 Kubernetes 集群正在运行一个 Device Plugin，ResourceName 为 hardware-vendor.example/foo。下面就是一个 Pod 示例，请求此资源以运行某演示负载：\n+++\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: demo-pod\nspec:\n  containers:\n    - name: demo-container-1\n      image: k8s.gcr.io/pause:2.0\n      resources:\n        limits:\n          hardware-vendor.example/foo: 2\n#\n# pod 需要两个 hardware-vendor.example/foo 设备\n# 而且只能够调度到满足需求的 node 上\n#\n# 如果该节点中有2个以上的设备可用，剩余的设备可供其他 pod 使用\n\n实现 Device Plugin\nDevice Plugin 的常规工作流程包括以下几个步骤：\n\n\n初始化。在这个阶段，Device Plugin 将执行供应商特定的初始化和设置，以确保设备处于就绪状态。\n\n\n使用主机路径 /var/lib/kubelet/device-plugins/ 下的 Unix socket 启动一个 gRPC 服务，该服务实现以下接口：\nservice DevicePlugin {\n    // GetDevicePluginOptions returns options to be communicated with Device Manager.\n    rpc GetDevicePluginOptions(Empty) returns (DevicePluginOptions) {}\n\n    // ListAndWatch returns a stream of List of Devices\n    // Whenever a Device state change or a Device disappears, ListAndWatch\n    // returns the new list\n    rpc ListAndWatch(Empty) returns (stream ListAndWatchResponse) {}\n\n    // Allocate is called during container creation so that the Device\n    // Plugin can run device specific operations and instruct Kubelet\n    // of the steps to make the Device available in the container\n    rpc Allocate(AllocateRequest) returns (AllocateResponse) {}\n\n    // GetPreferredAllocation returns a preferred set of devices to allocate\n    // from a list of available ones. The resulting preferred allocation is not\n    // guaranteed to be the allocation ultimately performed by the\n    // devicemanager. It is only designed to help the devicemanager make a more\n    // informed allocation decision when possible.\n    rpc GetPreferredAllocation(PreferredAllocationRequest) returns (PreferredAllocationResponse) {}\n\n    // PreStartContainer is called, if indicated by Device Plugin during registeration phase,\n    // before each container start. Device plugin can run device specific operations\n    // such as resetting the device before making devices available to the container.\n    rpc PreStartContainer(PreStartContainerRequest) returns (PreStartContainerResponse) {}\n}\n\n\n\n通过 Unix socket 在主机路径 /var/lib/kubelet/device-plugins/kubelet.sock 处向 kubelet 注册自身。\n\n\n成功注册自身后，Device Plugin 将以服务模式运行，之后，它将持续监控设备运行状况，并在设备状态发生任何变化时报告 kubelet。它还负责响应 Allocate gRPC 请求。 在 Allocate 期间，Device Plugin 可能还会做一些设备特定的准备；例如清理 GPU 或初始化 QRNG。如果操作成功，则 Device Plugin 将返回 AllocateResponse，其中包含用于访问被分配的设备容器运行时的配置。 kubelet 将此信息传递到容器运行时。\n\n\n处理 kubelet 重启\nDevice Plugin 应能监测到 kubelet 重启，并且向新的 kubelet 实例来重新注册自己。在当前实现中，当 kubelet 重启的时候，新的 kubelet 实例会删除 /var/lib/kubelet/device-plugins 下所有已经存在的 Unix sockets。 Device Plugin 需要能够监控到它的 Unix socket 被删除，并且当发生此类事件时重新注册自己。\n部署 Device Plugin\n用户可以将 Device Plugin 作为节点操作系统的软件包来部署、作为 DaemonSet 来部署或者手动部署。\n规范目录 /var/lib/kubelet/device-plugins 是需要特权访问的，所以 Device Plugin 必须要在被授权的安全的上下文中运行。如果将 Device Plugin 部署为 DaemonSet，/var/lib/kubelet/device-plugins 目录必须要在 DevicePlugin 的 PodSpec 中声明作为 Volume 被 mount 到 Device Plugin 中。\n若选择 DaemonSet 方法，用户可以通过 Kubernetes 进行以下操作: 将 Device Plugin 的 Pod 放置在节点上，在出现故障后重新启动守护进程 Pod，来进行自动升级。\nAPI 兼容性\nKubernetes Device Plugin 还处于 beta 版本。所以在稳定版本出来之前 API 会以不兼容的方式进行更改。作为一个项目，Kubernetes 建议 Device Plugin 开发者:\n\n注意未来版本的更改\n支持多个版本的 Device Plugin API，以实现向后/向前兼容性。\n\n如果你启用 DevicePlugins 功能，并在需要升级到 Kubernetes 版本来获得较新的 Device Plugin API 版本的节点上运行 Device Plugin，请在升级这些节点之前先升级 Device Plugin 以支持这两个版本。 采用该方法将确保升级期间设备分配的连续运行。\n监控 Device Plugin\n为了监控 Device Plugin 提供的资源，监控代理程序需要能够发现节点上正在使用的设备，并获取元数据来描述哪个指标与容器相关联。 设备监控代理暴露给 Prometheus 的指标应该遵循 Kubernetes Instrumentation Guidelines，使用 pod、namespace 和 container 标签来标识容器。\nkubelet 提供了 gRPC 服务来使得正在使用中的设备被发现，并且还未这些设备提供了元数据:\n// PodResourcesLister is a service provided by the kubelet that provides information about the\n// node resources consumed by pods and containers on the node\nservice PodResourcesLister {\n    rpc List(ListPodResourcesRequest) returns (ListPodResourcesResponse) {}\n}\n\ngRPC 服务通过 /var/lib/kubelet/pod-resources/kubelet.sock 的 UNIX 套接字来提供服务。 Device Plugin资源的监控代理程序可以部署为守护进程或者 DaemonSet。 规范的路径 /var/lib/kubelet/pod-resources 需要特权来进入， 所以监控代理程序必须要在获得授权的安全的上下文中运行。 如果设备监控代理以 DaemonSet 形式运行，必须要在插件的 PodSpec 中声明将 /var/lib/kubelet/pod-resources 目录以 卷的形式被挂载到容器中。\n对“PodResources 服务”的支持要求启用 KubeletPodResources 特性门控。 从 Kubernetes 1.15 开始默认启用。\nDevice Plugin 集成 The Topology Manager\nThe Topology Manager 是 Kubelet 的一个组件，它允许以拓扑对齐方式来调度资源。 为了做到这一点，Device Plugin API 进行了扩展来包括一个 TopologyInfo 结构体。\nmessage TopologyInfo {\n    repeated NUMANode nodes = 1;\n}\n\nmessage NUMANode {\n    int64 ID = 1;\n}\n\nDevice Plugin 希望 The Topology Manager 可以将填充的 TopologyInfo 结构体作为设备注册的一部分以及设备 ID 和设备的运行状况发送回去。然后 The Topology Manager 将使用此信息来咨询拓扑管理器并做出资源分配决策。\nTopologyInfo 支持定义 nodes 字段，允许为 nil（默认）或者是一个 NUMA 节点的列表。 这样就可以使Device Plugin可以跨越 NUMA 节点去发布。\n下面是一个由 Device Plugin 为设备填充 TopologyInfo 结构体的示例:\npluginapi.Device{ID: \"25102017\", Health: pluginapi.Healthy, Topology:&amp;pluginapi.TopologyInfo{Nodes: []*pluginapi.NUMANode{&amp;pluginapi.NUMANode{ID: 0,},}}}\n\n参考文档\n\nKubernetes Device Plugin\n\n","id":"https://blog.kiyoko.io/kubernetes-device-plugin/","title":"Kubernetes Device Plugin"},"https://blog.kiyoko.io/kubernetes-persistent-volume/":{"body":"","id":"https://blog.kiyoko.io/kubernetes-persistent-volume/","title":"Kubernetes 持久卷"},"https://blog.kiyoko.io/kubernetes-statefulset/":{"body":"StatefulSet 是用来管理有状态应用的工作负载 API 对象。\nStatefulSet 用来管理 Deployment 和扩展一组 Pod，并且能为这些 Pod 提供序号和唯一性保证。\n和 Deployment 相同的是，StatefulSet 管理了基于相同容器定义的一组 Pod。但和 Deployment 不同的是，StatefulSet 为它们的每个 Pod 维护了一个固定的 ID。这些 Pod 是基于相同的声明来创建的，但是不能相互替换：无论怎么调度，每个 Pod 都有一个永久不变的 ID。\nStatefulSet 和其他控制器使用相同的工作模式。你在 StatefulSet 对象 中定义你期望的状态，然后 StatefulSet 的 控制器 就会通过各种更新来达到那种你想要的状态。\n使用 StatefulSets\nStatefulSets 对于需要满足以下一个或多个需求的应用程序很有价值:\n\n稳定的、唯一的网络标识符。\n稳定的、持久的存储。\n有序的、优雅的部署和缩放。\n有序的、自动的滚动更新。\n\n在上面，稳定意味着 Pod 调度或重调度的整个过程是有持久性的。如果应用程序不需要任何稳定的标识符或有序的部署、删除或伸缩，则应该使用由一组无状态的副本控制器提供的工作负载来部署应用程序，比如 Deployment 或者 ReplicaSet 可能更适用于您的无状态应用部署需要。\n限制\n\n给定 Pod 的存储必须由 PersistentVolume 驱动 基于所请求的 storage class 来提供，或者由管理员预先提供。\n删除或者收缩 StatefulSet 并 不会删除 它关联的存储卷。这样做是为了保证数据安全，它通常比自动清除 StatefulSet 所有相关的资源更有价值。\nStatefulSet 当前需要 Headless Services 来负责 Pod 的网络标识。用户需要负责创建此服务。\n当删除 StatefulSets 时，StatefulSet 不提供任何终止 Pod 的保证。为了实现 StatefulSet 中的 Pod 可以有序和优雅的终止，可以在删除之前将 StatefulSet 缩放为 0。\n在默认 Pod 管理策略(OrderedReady) 时使用 滚动更新，可能进入需要 人工干预 才能修复的损坏状态。\n\n组件\n下面的示例演示了 StatefulSet 的组件。\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: nginx\n  labels:\n    app: nginx\nspec:\n  ports:\n  -

DirectoryOrCreate If nothing exists at the given path, an empty directory will be created there as needed with permission set to 0755, having the same group and ownership with Kubelet. Directory A directory must exist at the given path FileOrCreate If nothing exists at the given path, an empty file will be created there as needed with permission set to 0644, having the same group and ownership with Kubelet. File A file must exist at the given path Socket A UNIX socket must exist at the given path CharDevice A character device must exist at the given path BlockDevice A block device must exist at the given path\nWatch out when using this type of volume, because:\nPods with identical configuration (such as created from a podTemplate) may behave differently on different nodes due to different files on the nodes\nwhen Kubernetes adds resource-aware scheduling, as is planned, it will not be able to account for resources used by a hostPath\nthe files or directories created on the underlying hosts are only writable by root.

19 days, 12:05,  1 user,  load average: 1.25, 1.42, 1.29\nTasks: 258 total,   2 running, 197 sleeping,   0 stopped,   0 zombie\n%Cpu(s):  9.1 us,  6.8 sy,  0.3 ni, 78.1 id,  5.2 wa,  0.0 hi,  0.5 si,

1.31\n\n可以发现，uptime 指令的输出与 top 指令输出的第一行几乎一致。具体每一部分的含义为:\n\n当前时间: 23:10:12\n运行时间: up 19 days, 12:05\n登录用户数量: 1 user\n平均负载: 过去 1min，3min，5min 的平均负载\n\n什么是平均负载\n首先，需要强调:\n\n平均负载不等于 CPU 使用率！！！\n平均负载不等于 CPU 使用率！！！\n平均负载不等于 CPU 使用率！！！\n\n而是，系统处于 可运行状态 和 不可中断状态 的平均进程数，即 平均活跃进程数。与 CPU 使用率没有直接关系。\n\n可运行状态: 正在使用 CPU 或者正在等待 CPU 的进程。即 ps 指令显示为 R 状态 (Running/Runable) 的进程。\n不可中断状态: 处于内核态关键流程中的进程，且不可打断。比如最常见的是等待硬件设备的 I/O 响应，即 ps 指令中中看到的 D 状态 (Uninterruptible Sleep/Disk Sleep) 的进程。\n\n比如，当一个进程向磁盘读写数据时，为了保证数据的一致性，在得到磁盘回复前，它是不能被其他 进程 或者 中断 打断的，这个时候的进程就处于不可中断状态。如果此时的进程被打断了，就容易出现磁盘数据与进程数据不一致的问题。\n所以，不可中断状态实际上是系统对进程和硬件设备的一种保护机制。\n评估平均负载\n可以简单的认为，平均负载就是活跃的进程数。所以，最理想的场景是每个 CPU 都只需要处理一个进程，即 CPU 数量等于平均负载值。\n因此，在分析系统平均负载是否合理时，首先应该知道当前系统的 CPU 数量。\n平均负载可以简单的认为是活跃进程数:\n$ cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep -i 'model name' | wc -l\n16\n\n之后，就可以通过比较 CPU 的数量与平均负载大小关系，确认系统是否过载。\n同时，结合过去 1min，5min，15min 的系统负载，就可以推测出系统负载的变化趋势。\n当平均负载超过 CPU 50% 时，可以认为负载较高；当超过 70% 时，就应该开发分析导致高负载的原因。同时，也应该将平均负载作为一项监控指标。只有结合历史数据来分析才更有意义。\n平均负载与 CPU 使用率\n平均负载 表示为一定时间内，处于 可运行状态 和 不可中断状态 的进程数量。核心在于 进程数量。\n\nR 状态: 运行状态，会使用到 CPU\nD 状态: 不可中断状态，处于内核态等待 I/O 响应，不使用 CPU。\n\nCPU 使用率 表示为一定时间内 CPU 的繁忙情况。核心在于进程占用 CPU 的时间占总时间的百分比。\n因此，应该将二者结合一起使用:\n\nCPU 密集型进程，使用大量 CPU 会导致平均负载升高，此时这两者是一致的\nI/O 密集型进程，等待 I/O 会导致平均负载升高，但 CPU 使用率不一定很高\n大量等待 CPU 的进程调度也会导致平均负载升高，此时的 CPU 使用率也会比较高。\n\n案例分析\n系统初始状态为:\n$ uptime\n 16:39:57 up 1 day,  2:52,  0 users,  load average: 0.10, 0.05, 0.06\n\n安装工具\nsudo pacman -S stress sysstat\n\nCPU 密集型\n首先，在 Terminal No.1 使用 stress 模拟一个 CPU 密集型进程:\n$ stress --cpu 1 --timeout 6000\nstress: info: [5049] dispatching hogs: 1 cpu, 0 io, 0 vm, 0 hdd\n\n然后，在 Terminal No.2 查看平均负载:\n$ watch -d uptime\nEvery 2.0s: uptime                zephyrus:

heart of most storage systems that provide high write throughput, be it a key-value storage like dynamodb/cassandra or a messaging system like pulsar which is backed by bookkeeper.\nThe various components of a typical LSM backed system are shown below.\n\nThe main reason why LSM provides high write throughput is that every write request is actually performed only in-memory in contrast to traditional B-Tree based implementation where the updates are done to disk which can trigger an update to an index making it very expensive.\nSo the obvious question is, how does LSM achieve durability? that’s where WAL comes into the picture.\nWAL\nWAL is a write-ahead log that is used to provide the durability of data during system failures, what it means is that when a request for write comes in, the data is first added to a WAL file (sometimes called journal) and flushed to the disk (using direct io) before updating the in-memory data structure.\nThis allows for systems to recover from the WAL if it crashes before persisting the in-memory data structure to disk.\nWhy not directly update the write to the disk instead of updating WAL? it’s because WAL updates are cheaper as it’s append-only and doesn’t require any restructuring of data on disk.\nMemTable\nThe in-memory data structure is called a memtable, there are various implementations of memtable, but you can think of memtable as just a binary search tree for the sake of simplicity.\nSo now for every write request, the data is appended to WAL and the memtable is updated and a successful response is returned to the client.\nFor java implementations, the memtable is usually stored off-heap (direct memory) to avoid GC load\nSSTable (Sorted Strings Table)\nAs it’s obvious that we cannot keep adding data to memtable to bloat the RAM, the memtable is frequently flushed to disk as an SSTable.\nSSTable, as the name indicates, is a sorted array of keys persisted on disk.\nThe reason it is sorted is to make it easy to look up the data for readings.\nOkay, now that is the essence of how LSM provides high throughput using a WAL, MemTable &amp; SSTable.\nUsually, even every delete request for a key is also added to memtable with a marker indicating it’s deleted and the same information is flushed to the SSTable.\nCompactor\nAs we keep flushing SSTables to disk, the same key may be present in multiple SSTables, although the latest data of a key is present in the most recent SSTable, it’s presence in all previous SSTable needs to be cleaned up.\nThis is the job of a compactor which usually runs in the background, It merges SSTables by removing redundant &amp; deleted keys and creating a compacted/merged SSTables.\nthe compactor also is responsible for updating an index (typical B-Tree based index) to locate SSTable a key is present in.\nIndex\nThe index data structure created is used to locate the correct SSTable for a key, once an SSTable is located, it is easy to locate the actual key inside the SSTable as it’s sorted, a binary search in-memory is sufficient.\nAlso, the size of SSTables is chosen in such a way that it corresponds to the operating system page size (usually multiples of disk bock size) making it easier to load the data to memory faster.\nAlthough the Index along with SSTable help in faster lookup of keys, all read requests are first consulted in the memtable as it should contain the most recent change. If the key is not in the memtable, then the index is used to identify the possible SSTable the key may be present and then search inside the SSTable in-memory.\nSince every read has to check the memtable, index &amp; SSTable to look for a key, it makes read requests very expensive especially for keys that are not present!\nFor keys that are recently updated, the read request will easily locate it in the memtable, but for keys not recently updated, and for keys that are not present in the system the read path is expensive!\nBloom Filters are used to improve read performance especially for the cases where the key is not present in the system.\nBloom Filter\nA Bloom filter is a probabilistic data structure, which at a high level helps you check if a key is present or not in the system with O(1) complexity in memory.\nWith bloom filter, False positive match is possible, which means, it may indicate a key is present although it’s not in the system. But false-negative match won’t happen, which means if bloom filter indicates a key is not present, then it is definitely not present in the system, so we could avoid taking the expensive read path.\nSo the presence of a bloom filter improves the read performance for keys that are missing in the system but for the keys that are present in the system, the read is still expensive as we have to look into the memtable, index and the SSTable.\nSummary\nSo every time you come across a system that promises high write throughput, you can assume there will be a variant of LSM tree underneath that helps achieve the throughput and also understand why reads are expensive.\n","id":"https://blog.kiyoko.io/log-structured-merge-trees/","title":"Log Structured Merge

等硬件如何操作。我们要努力做到硬件操作的最小化。\n对于研究数据库性能的初学者而言，可以从学习数据库的高级规则和准则开始，学会使用时钟时间来作为衡量性能的指标。而对于那些想要成为数据库性能优化领域的专家的人来说，则需要他们了解更多关于数据库底层的知识，能使用更具有一般性的指标，诸如 CPU 周期和 I/O 操作等来衡量性能。\n大部分的用户，希望从其现有的软件和硬件配置中获得最佳的数据库性能。进阶用户则专注于寻找机会改进 MySQL 软件本身，或者开发自己的存储引擎和硬件设备以扩展 MySQL 生态系统。\n在数据库级别进行优化\n使数据库应用程序快速运行的最重要因素是其基本设计：\n\n\n表格的结构是否正确？ 特别是，这些列是否具有正确的数据类型，并且每个表都具有适合于该工作类型的列吗？ 例如，执行频繁更新的应用程序通常具有许多表而具有很少的列，而分析大量数据的应用程序通常具有很少的表而具有很多列。\n\n\n是否安装了正确的索引以提高查询效率？\n\n\n您是否为每个表使用了适当的存储引擎，并利用了所使用的每个存储引擎的优势和功能？ 特别是，对于性能和可伸缩性而言，选择事务存储引擎（例如 InnoDB）或非事务存储引擎（例如 MyISAM）可能非常重要。\n\n注意\nInnoDB 是新表的默认存储引擎。 实际上，先进的 InnoDB 性能功能意味着 InnoDB 表通常优于简单的 MyISAM 表，尤其是对于繁忙的数据库。\n\n\n\n每个表都使用适当的行格式吗？ 该选择还取决于表使用的存储引擎。 特别是，压缩表使用较少的磁盘空间，因此需要较少的磁盘I / O来读取和写入数据。 压缩可用于带有 InnoDB 表的所有类型的工作负载以及只读的 MyISAM 表。\n\n\n应用程序是否使用适当的锁定策略？ 例如，通过在可能的情况下允许共享访问，以便数据库操作可以同时运行，并在适当的时候请求独占访问，以使关键操作获得最高优先级。 同样，存储引擎的选择很重要。 InnoDB存储引擎无需您的参与即可处理大多数锁定问题，从而可以更好地并发数据库并减少代码的试验和调整量。\n\n\n用于缓存的所有内存区域大小是否正确？ 也就是说，足够大以容纳经常访问的数据，但又不能太大以至于它们会使物理内存过载并导致分页。 要配置的主要内存区域是 InnoDB 缓冲池和 MyISAM 密钥缓存。\n\n\n在硬件级别进行优化\n随着数据库变得越来越繁忙，任何数据库应用程序最终都会达到硬件极限。 DBA必须评估是否有可能调整应用程序或重新配置服务器以避免这些瓶颈，或者是否需要更多的硬件资源。 系统瓶颈通常来自以下来源：\n\n磁盘搜寻。 磁盘查找数据需要花费时间。 对于现代磁盘，此操作的平均时间通常小于10毫秒，因此理论上我们可以执行100次搜索。 这段时间随着新磁盘的使用而缓慢改善，并且很难为单个表进行优化。 优化寻道时间的方法是将数据分发到多个磁盘上。\n磁盘读写。 当磁盘位于正确的位置时，我们需要读取或写入数据。 对于现代磁盘，一个磁盘至少可提供10–20MB / s的吞吐量。 与查找相比，优化起来更容易，因为您可以从多个磁盘并行读取。\nCPU周期。 当数据位于主存储器中时，我们必须对其进行处理以获得结果。 与内存量相比，拥有较大的表是最常见的限制因素。 但是对于小桌子，速度通常不是问题。\n内存带宽。 当CPU需要的数据超出CPU缓存的容量时，主内存带宽将成为瓶颈。 对于大多数系统来说，这是一个不常见的瓶颈，但是要意识到这一点。\n\n平衡便携性和性能\nMySQL 支持在 SQL 注释中（/*！*/）通过特定的关键字来指定优化策略。而且，因为是在注释中，会被其他的 SQL 服务忽略，因此，SQL 语句仍然是可移植的。有关编写注释的信息，请参见 8.9.3 优化器提示，9.6 注释语法。\n","id":"https://blog.kiyoko.io/mysql-optimization-overview/","title":"MySQL

中。这样，多个应用之间就会因为有了边界而避免相互干扰。并且，应用被装进箱子后，也便于移动。\n进程\n要实现一个程序，从一个文件读取两个整数，将计算结果写入到另一个文件中，则至少需要有三个文件:\n\n可执行文件\n输入文件\n输出文件\n\n由于计算机只认识 0 和 1，因此无论用哪种语言编写这段代码，最后这三个文件都需要通过某种方式翻译成二进制文件，才能在计算机操作系统中运行与使用。初始状态时，三个文件都存放在磁盘上。可执行文件被称作 程序，剩余两个文件是 数据。\n要完成功能，需要在计算机上执行这个程序。\n首先，操作系统将 程序 载入到内存中，表现为指令序列。在执行过程中，当执行到从文件加载输入数据的指令时，操作系统控制存储控制器完成将数据从磁盘载入到内存。之后，操作系统读取到计算加法的指令时，通过 CPU、寄存器与内存的共同协作完成加法计算将计算结果暂存在内存中。最后，执行将结果保存到文件的指令时，操作系统会通过存储控制器，将内存中的结果写入到磁盘上。同时，操作系统中还需要维护其他状态，辅助这一过程顺利进行。\n在操作系统中，将上述过程所涉及到的总和称作: 进程。\n而容器技术的核心功能，就是通过约束和修改进程的动态表现，从而为其创造出一个 边界。\n对于 Docker 等大多数 Linux 容器来说，使用 cgroups 技术来制造约束，使用 namespace 技术来修改进程视图。\n创建容器\n首先创建一个容器:\n$ docker run --help\nUsage:  docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG...]\n\n$ docker run -it busybox /bin/sh\nUnable to find image 'busybox:latest' locally\nlatest: Pulling from library/busybox\n91f30d776fb2: Pull complete\nDigest: sha256:9ddee63a712cea977267342e8750ecbc60d3aab25f04ceacfa795e6fce341793\nStatus: Downloaded newer

/bin/sh。并且，在容器启动之后，申请了一个随机的 tty，使用交互方式访问这个容器。\n现在，执行 ps 指令，结果真是 Amazing 啊:\n/ # ps\nPID   USER     TIME  COMMAND\n    1 root      0:00 /bin/sh\n    6 root      0:00 ps\n\n在创建容器时指定的 /bin/sh 进程，竟然就是容器内部的第一个进程(pid=1)，并且，这个容器内只有两个进程正在运行中，另一个进程是正在执行的 ps 指令。\n而这正是 namespace 技术的神奇之处。\nNamespace\n首先，通过 manpages 对 namespace 有一个初步的了解:\n$ man namespaces\nNAMESPACES(7)                       Linux Programmer's Manual                       NAMESPACES(7)\n\nNAME\n       namespaces - overview of Linux namespaces\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       A namespace wraps a global system resource in an abstraction that makes it appear to the processes\n       within the namespace that they have their own isolated instance of the global resource. Changes to\n       the global resource are visible to other processes that are members of the namespace, but are\n       invisible to other processes. One use of namespaces is to implement containers.\n\n       This page provides pointers to information on the various namespace types, describes the associated\n      /proc files, and summarizes the APIs for working with namespaces.\n       ...\n\n总的来说，Linux Namespace 提供了一种内核级别隔离系统资源的方法，通过将系统的全局资源放在不同的 Namespace 中，来实现资源隔离的目的。不同 Namespace 的程序，可以享有一份独立的系统资源。目前 Linux 中提供了以下几种系统资源的隔离机制：\nNamespaceFlagPageIsolates\nCgroupCLONE_NEWCGROUPcgroup_namespaces(7)Cgroup root directory\nIPCCLONE_NEWIPCipc_namespaces(7)System V IPC, POSIX message queues\nNetworkCLONE_NEWNETnetwork_namespaces(7)Network devices, stacks, ports, etc.\nMountCLONE_NEWNSmount_namespaces(7)Mount points\nPIDCLONE_NEWPIDpid_namespaces(7)Process IDs\nTimeCLONE_NEWTIMEtime_namespaces(7)Boot and monotonic clocks\nUserCLONE_NEWUSERuser_namespaces(7)User and group IDs\nUTSCLONE_NEWUTSuts_namespaces(7)Hostname and NIS domain name\n\n如何使用 Namespace 技术\n以 PID Namespace 为例，简单说明如何在编程中使用这种技术。\nLinux 实现 Namespace 机制的方式，是通过在创建进程的时候，传入特定的选项。更具体一些，就是在调用\n$ man 2 clone\nCLONE(2)                            Linux Programmer's Manual                           CLONE(2)\n\nNAME\n       clone, __clone2, clone3 - create a child process\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       /* Prototype for the glibc wrapper function */\n\n       #define _GNU_SOURCE\n       #include &lt;sched.h&gt;\n\n       int clone(int (*fn)(void *), void *stack, int flags, void *arg, ...\n                 /* pid_t *parent_tid, void *tls, pid_t *child_tid */ );\n\n系统调用时，传入对应的 Flag 作为参数 flag 的值。比如:\nint pid = clone(main_function, stack_size, SIGCHLD, NULL);\n\n就会创建一个新的进程，并且返回它的进程号 pid。\n如果，同时指定 CLONE_NEWPID 参数:\nint pid = clone(main_function, stack_size, CLONE_NEWPID | SIGCHLD, NULL);\n\n新创建进程将会 看到 一个全新的进程空间，在这个进程空间里，它的 pid 是 1。之所以说 看到，是因为这只是一个 障眼法，在宿主机真实的进程空间里，这个进程的 pid 还是真实的数值，比如 404。\n如果多次执行上面的 clone() 调用，就会创建多个 PID Namespace，而每个 Namespace 里的应用进程都会认为自己是当前容器里的 第 1 号进程，它们既看不到宿主机里真正的进程空间，也看不到其他 PID Namespace 里的具体情况。\n而其他的几种 Namespace，在写法上与 PID Namespace 是相同的，区别只在于目的不同。\n所以，Docker 容器这个听起来玄而又玄的概念，实际上是在创建容器进程时，指定了这个进程所需要启用的一组 Namespace 参数。这样，容器就只能 看到 当前 Namespace 所限定的资源、文件、设备、状态，或者配置。而对于宿主机以及其他不相关的程序，它就完全看不到了。\n本质仍旧是进程。因此，在之前出现过的虚拟机对比容器的图片中，才没有出现 Docker 的位置。因为，容器只是通过 Namespace 技术被隔离的进程，与其他进程一样，也是直接运行在宿主机操作系统之上的。Docker 只是充当了一个管理者的身份。\n\n既然，虚拟机与容器是两种不同的技术，那么二者之间就应该有一些区别。\n容器的优势\n占用资源小\n容器占用的内存，要比同等功能的虚拟机占用的内存小，因为虚拟机本身也需要消耗一定的资源。比如，运行 CentOS 的 KVM 虚拟机至少需要 100 ~ 200 MB 的内存\n更好的 I/O 性能\n在参考阅读 An Updated Performance Comparison of Virtual Machines and Linux Containers 中显示\n\n在随机读写场景中，无论是 iops 还是 latency，容器的性能都接近于物理机性能，远好于 KVM 虚拟机\n在顺序读写场景中，容器的性能基本与物理机性能，略好于 KVM 虚拟机\n在 host network 场景中，容器的性能接近于物理机的性能，好于 KVM 虚拟机\n在 nat network 场景中，容器的性能略逊于 KVM 虚拟机，但差别不大\n\n总的来说，容器的 I/O 性能优于 KVM 虚拟机\n容器的劣势\n平台依赖性\n\n尽管，可以通过 Mount Namespace 的方式挂起与宿主机不同的 Linux 发行版，但容器中进程使用的内核依然是宿主机的内核。\n\n因此 Windows 耗费了那么长的时间才对容器技术有了比较好的支持。\n同样，也无法在低版本内核的宿主机上运行高版本内核的容器。\n\n\n\n有限的隔离\n部分资源无法被隔离，比如 时间。\n如果在容器中调用 settimeofday(2) 系统调用修改系统时间，会导致宿主机系统的时间被修改，这显然是一个很可怕的事情。因此，在使用容器的时候必须要了解 什么能做，什么不能做。\nCgroup\nNamespace 技术的作用是隔离进程，但只有隔离是不够的。虽然，容器内的进程无法感知到其他运行在宿主机上的进程或容器，但从操作系统的角度而言，所有的进程与容器都是平等的地位。这就意味着，虽然容器是一个独立的小空间，但其可用的资源仍旧与其他进程之间有着竞争的关系。\n因此，就需要用到 Cgroup 技术的帮助了。\nCgroup 全称为 Control Group，用途是限制一个进程组能够使用的资源上限，包括 CPU、MEM、DISK、NETWORK 等。\nCgroup In Action\n在 Linux 中 Everything is a file，因此，操作 Cgroup 的途径也是通过文件系统。\n$ mount -t cgroup\ncgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,cpuset)\ncgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,cpu)\ncgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuacct type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,cpuacct)\ncgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/blkio type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,blkio)\ncgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/memory type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,memory)\ncgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/devices type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,devices)\ncgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/freezer type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,freezer)\ncgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/net_cls type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,net_cls)\ncgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/perf_event type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,perf_event)\ncgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/net_prio type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,net_prio)\ncgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/hugetlb type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,hugetlb)\ncgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/pids type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,pids)\ncgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/rdma type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,rdma)\n\n可以看到，Cgroup 是一系列定义在 /sys/fs/cgroup/ 目录下的各种文件或文件夹。每一个文件夹都被用来限制某一种特定的资源。以 cpu 资源为例:\n$ ls /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu\n000-metadata  cgroup.clone_children  cpu.cfs_period_us  cpu.rt_runtime_us  docker    notify_on_release  systemreserved\n001-binfmt    cgroup.procs           cpu.cfs_quota_us   cpu.shares         kmsg      podruntime         tasks\n002-bridge    cgroup.sane_behavior   cpu.rt_period_us   cpu.stat           kubepods  release_agent\n\n列举了限制 cpu 资源的各种参数选项。\n使用 Cgroup 的方式非常简单，在对应的资源目录下面创建一个目录，比如:\n$ sudo mkdir -p /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/container\n\n$ ls /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/container\ncgroup.clone_children  cpu.cfs_period_us  cpu.rt_period_us   cpu.shares  notify_on_release\ncgroup.procs           cpu.cfs_quota_us   cpu.rt_runtime_us  cpu.stat    tasks\n\n这个目录被称作 控制组，Linux 会在控制组下自动创建各种资源限制文件。\n然后，在后台执行脚本:\n$ while : ; do : ; done &amp;\n[1] 12555\n\n显然，这是一个死循环进程，会占用 100% 的 CPU。使用 top 指令，也可以确认确实使用了 100% 的 CPU。\n$ top -p 12555\ntop -

定义就能明白:\nGLEWAPI GLenum GLEWAPIENTRY glewInit (void);\n\n再跳转到 GLEWAPI 的宏定义:\n#ifdef GLEW_STATIC\n#  define GLEWAPI extern\n#else\n#  ifdef GLEW_BUILD\n#    define GLEWAPI extern __declspec(dllexport)\n#  else\n#    define GLEWAPI extern __declspec(dllimport)\n#  endif\n#endif\n\n可以发现，由于 GLEW_STATIC 与 GLEW_BUILD 均未定义，因此，会使用\ndefine GLEWAPI extern

绘制图形要麻烦一些，因为需要自己编写 Shader 程序。\nShader 编程\nShader 的本质是一个运行在 GPU 上面的程序，因为图形的渲染由 GPU 负责，因此需要对 GPU 编程告诉 GPU 如何渲染，这个很好理解，就像使用 c/c++ 等通用语言对 CPU 编程一样。\n因此，编写一个 Shader 程序至少需要 2 部分:\n\n需要被 GPU 渲染的数据\n需要被 GPU 执行的程序\n\n注: 之后的一切都建立在 GLFW 与 GLEW 初始化成功之后。\n本次内容会涉及到两种不同的 Shader:\n\nVertexShader: 作用于每个 Vertex，通常是处理从世界空间到裁剪空间(屏幕坐标)的坐标转换，后接光栅化。\nFragmentShader: 作用于每个屏幕上的 Fragment

描述符\n\nGlShaderSource\n有了 Shader 之后，需要设置(替换) Shader 中的代码:\nvoid glShaderSource(GLuint          shader,\n                    GLsizei         count,\n                    const GLchar ** string,\n                    const GLint *   length);\n\n\nshader: 目标 Shader 描述符\ncount: string 数组与 length 数组的长度\nstring: 加载到 Shader 的字符串数组\nlength: 字符串长度数组，与 string 相对应。如果 length 参数为 NULL，则假设每一个字符串以 null 结束。否则，则认为每一个元素表示相对应字符串的长度，小于 0 同样被认为以 null 结束。\n\n使用传入的 string 参数设置 Shader 的源代码，原有代码会被完全替换。并且，根据函数可知，一个 Shader 可以设置多份源代码。\nGlCompileShader\n与 c/c++ 编写的程序一样，需要经过编译操作才能被执行，同样 Shader 代码也需要被编译，传入之前创建的 Shader 描述符:\nvoid glCompileShader(GLuint shader);\n\n\nshader: Shader 描述符\n\n编译部分完整代码\nstatic unsigned int ComplieShader(unsigned int type, const std::string&amp; source) {\n    unsigned int id = glCreateShader(type);\n    const char* src = source.c_str();\n    glShaderSource(id, 1, &amp;src, nullptr);\n    glCompileShader(id);\n\n    int result = 0;\n    glGetShaderiv(id, GL_COMPILE_STATUS, &amp;result);\n    // 错误处理\n    if (GL_FALSE == result) {\n        int length = 0;\n        glGetShaderiv(id, GL_INFO_LOG_LENGTH, &amp;length);\n        char* message = (char*)alloca(length * sizeof(char));\n        glGetShaderInfoLog(id, length, &amp;length, message);\n        std::cout &lt;&lt;\n            \"Failed compile \" &lt;&lt;\n            ((type == GL_VERTEX_SHADER) ? \"vertex\" : \"fragment\") &lt;&lt;\n            \" shader: \" &lt;&lt; source &lt;&lt;\n            \" error: \" &lt;&lt; message &lt;&lt;\n            std::endl;\n        glDeleteShader(id);\n        return 0;\n    }\n\n    return id;\n}\n\n创建 Program\nGlCreateProgram\n首先需要创建一个程序对象，可以类比为一个可执行程序:\nGLuint glCreateProgram(void);\n\nGlAttachShader\n一个完整的 Shader 程序可能需要由若干个 Shader 组成，因此需要有一种将他们链接到一起的机制。glAttachShader 函数的作用是在链接之前，将 Shader 添加到 Program 上。可以类比为 Cmake 中的 target_link_libraries 函数，program 是 executable，shader 是 libraries:\nvoid glAttachShader(GLuint program,\n                    GLuint shader);\n\n\nprogram: 程序描述符\nshader: Shader 描述符\n\nGlLinkProgram\n当所有必要的 Shader 都添加到 program 上之后，就可以将他们链接起来了。类似于 c/c++ 程序的链接阶段。\n将 program 关联的所有 Shader 链接到一起，并根据 Shader 的类型，创建可执行程序交给相应的可编程处理器执行。\nvoid glLinkProgram(GLuint program);\n\n链接阶段完整代码\n// CreateProgram 输入 Shader 源码，返回相应的 Shader 程序\nstatic unsigned int CreateProgram(const std::string&amp; vertexShader, const std::string&amp; fragmentShader) {\n    unsigned int program = glCreateProgram();\n    unsigned int vs = ComplieShader(GL_VERTEX_SHADER, vertexShader);\n    unsigned int fs = ComplieShader(GL_FRAGMENT_SHADER, fragmentShader);\n\n    glAttachShader(program, vs);\n    glAttachShader(program, fs);\n    glLinkProgram(program);\n    glValidateProgram(program);\n    glDeleteShader(vs);\n    glDeleteShader(fs);\n    return program;\n}\n\n执行 Shader 程序\nGlUseProgram\n正确链接的程序，需要通过 glUseProgram 函数显式执行才能进行渲染，类似于 c/c++ 代码编译之后执行 ./a.out。\nvoid glUseProgram(GLuint program);\n\n需要在进入主渲染循环之前调用该函数。\n","id":"https://blog.kiyoko.io/opengl-03/","title":"使用 GLEW 绘制三角形"},"https://blog.kiyoko.io/openmpi-in-docker/":{"body":"构建 Base 镜像\n基于 Ubuntu 20.04 + OpenMPI 4.0.5 构建

TABLE ... AS SELECT，INSERT INTO ... SELECT 和 DELETE 语句中的 WHERE 子句。但由于这些语句同时会涉及到读写两种操作，因此还需要考虑其他方面的性能问题。\n多节点集群支持 JOIN 查询下推优化(join pushdown optimization)，能将符合条件的 JOIN 完整地发送到集群的数据节点，让这个查询请求被分发到这些节点上并行执行。有关此优化的更多信息，请参见Conditions for NDB pushdown joins。\n优化查询的核心因素：\n\n\n如何查询语句 SELECT ... WHERE 执行的非常之慢，首选提速方法就是检查是否可以添加索引。在 WHERE 子句中使用的列上设置索引，以加快执行，过滤，检索结果等操作的速度。同时，索引信息需要占用一定的磁盘空间，请尽可能在有一定关联性的查询中复用索引。\n在执行 JOIN 查询，外键关联等需要多个表参与的查询语句时，索引尤为重要。此时，可以通过 EXPLAIN 语句来确定，执行 SELECT 语句时，实际有哪些索引真正被使用了。参见 Section 8.3.1, “How MySQL Uses Indexes” and Section 8.8.1, “Optimizing Queries with EXPLAIN”。\n\n\n隔离和调整查询中花费时间过多的任何部分，例如函数调用。 根据查询的结构方式，可以对结果集中的每一行调用一次函数，甚至可以对表中的每一行调用一次函数，从而极大地提高了效率。\n\n\n最小化查询中全表扫描的次数，特别是对于大表。\n\n\n通过定期使用 ANALYZE TABLE 语句使表统计信息保持最新状态，让优化器具有充足的信息构造有效执行计划。\n\n\n了解每种存储引擎的调整技术，索引技术和配置参数。无论是 InnoDB 还是 MyISAM，都各自具有一套保持查询高性能的准则。参见 Section 8.5.6, “Optimizing InnoDB Queries” 和 Section 8.6.1, “Optimizing MyISAM Queries”。\n\n\n使用 Section 8.5.3, “Optimizing InnoDB Read-Only Transactions” 中的技术优化 InnoDB 表的单查询事务。\n\n\n避免以难以理解的方式转换查询，特别是在优化器自动执行某些相同转换的情况下。\n\n\n当使用基本准则不能轻松解决性能问题时，可以通过阅读 EXPLAIN 计划并调整索引，WHERE，JOIN 等子句来调查特定查询的内部详细信息。(有一定经验之后，阅读 EXPLAIN 计划可能是每个查询的第一步。)\n\n\n调整 MySQL 用于缓存的内存区域的大小和属性。合理使用 InnoDB 的buffer pool，MyISAM 的 key cache 和 MySQL 的 query cache，可以让重复查询的运行速度更快。\n\n\n即使查询已经使用了内存缓存，也依然可能对其进一步优化，使其需要更少的内存，从而使应用程序更具可伸缩性。比如，应用程序可以同时处理更多的用户，更大的请求量，而不会导致性能大幅下降。\n\n\n锁定问题，多个会话同时访问同一张表可能会影响查询速度。\n\n\n更多优化策略\n\nWHERE Clause Optimization\nRange Optimization\nIndex Merge Optimization\nHash Join Optimization\nEngine Condition Pushdown Optimization\nIndex Condition Pushdown Optimization\nNested-Loop Join Algorithms\nNested Join Optimization\nOuter Join Optimization\nOuter Join Simplification\nMulti-Range Read Optimization\nBlock Nested-Loop and Batched Key Access Joins\nCondition Filtering\nConstant-Folding Optimization\nIS NULL Optimization\nORDER BY Optimization\nGROUP BY Optimization\nDISTINCT Optimization\nLIMIT Query Optimization\nFunction Call Optimization\nWindow Function Optimization\nRow Constructor Expression Optimization\nAvoiding Full Table Scans\n\n","id":"https://blog.kiyoko.io/optimizing-select-statements/","title":"优化 SELECT 语句"},"https://blog.kiyoko.io/optimizing-sql-statements/":{"body":"\nOptimizing SELECT Statements\nOptimizing Subqueries, Derived Tables, View References, and Common Table Expressions\nOptimizing INFORMATION_SCHEMA Queries\nOptimizing Performance Schema Queries\nOptimizing Data Change Statements\nOptimizing Database Privileges\nOther Optimization Tips\n\n数据库应用程序的核心逻辑是通过 SQL 语句执行的，无论这些 SQL 语句是通过解释程序直接发出还是通过调用 API 提交。之后提到的调整准则有助于加快各种使用到 MySQL 应用程序的速度。指南涵盖了读写数据的 SQL 操作，通用 SQL 操作的底层开销以及在特定方案（例如数据库监视）中使用的操作。\n","id":"https://blog.kiyoko.io/optimizing-sql-statements/","title":"优化SQL语句"},"https://blog.kiyoko.io/play-with-k8s/":{"body":"Play with Kubernetes 是一个可以在浏览器使用的 CentOS 虚拟机环境，允许用户通过 github 账号登录。在这里，用户可以部署，学习使用 k8s。\n跳过前面一些很简单的操作。在左侧添加 4 台虚拟机。每一台新创建的虚拟机控制台界面会有如下的提示:\n 1.

状态"},"https://blog.kiyoko.io/programming-open-closed-principle/":{"body":"什么是开闭原则\n需求变化 是让开发者最为头痛的问题之一。通常在新增一个功能的时候，都会伴随着修改原有的代码。因此，理想情况是在新增功能时尽可能减少对已有代码的改动，避免因改动代码引入新的问题。\n由此产生了一个编码设计原则: 开闭原则 (Open Close Principle)。\n\nSoftware entities like classes, modules and functions should be open for extension but closed for modifications.\n\n举个栗子 —— 用户注册模块\n原始需求\n业务初期，只允许使用邮箱注册，因此，需要实现向邮箱发送验证码的功能。\n定义邮箱发送类，用于发送验证码:\ntype EmailMessageSender struct {\n}\n\nfunc (e *EmailMessageSender) SendVerificationCode(code string) {\n  fmt.Println(\"Code: \", code)\n}\n\n定义服务类，调用邮箱发送类发送消息:\ntype MessageService struct {\n  emailSender *EmailMessageSender\n}\n\nfunc NewMessageService() *MessageService {\n  return &amp;MessageService{\n    emailSender: &amp;EmailMessageSender{}\n  }\n}\n\nfunc (s *MessageService) SendVerificationCode(code string) {\n  s.emailSender.SendVerificationCode(code)\n}\n\n调用方式为:\nfunc main() {\n  service := NewMessageService()\n  service.SendVerificationCode(\"10086\")\n}\n\n增加需求\n后来业务要求，允许使用手机号注册，通过短信的方式接受验证码。\n因此，增加发送短信类:\ntype ShortMessageSender struct {\n}\n\nfunc (e *ShortMessageSender) SendVerificationCode(code string) {\n  fmt.Println(\"Code: \", code)\n}\n\n同时，需要修改 MessageService 类:\ntype MessageService struct {\n  emailSender        *EmailMessageSender\n  shortMessageSender *ShortMessageSender\n}\n\n还需要通过某种方式制定使用哪种途径发送消息，例如增加一个表示类型的参数:\ntype MessageSender int\n\nconst (\n  MessageSenderEmail        MessageSender = iota\n  MessageSenderShortMessage\n)\n\nfunc NewMessageService(typ MessageSender) *MessageService {\n  switch typ {\n    case MessageSenderEmail:\n      return &amp;MessageService{\n        emailSender: &amp;EmailMessageSender{}\n      }\n    case MessageSenderShortMessage:\n      return &amp;MessageService{\n        shortMessageSender: &amp;ShortMessageSender{}\n      }\n    default:\n      panic(fmt.Sprintf(\"unknown sender type: %s\", typ))\n  }\n}\n\nfunc (s *MessageService) SendVerificationCode(code string) {\n  if s.emailSender != nil {\n    s.emailSender.SendVerificationCode(code)\n  }\n  if s.shortMessageSender != nil {\n    s.shortMessageSender.SendVerificationCode(code)\n  }\n}\n\n调用方式为:\nfunc main() {\n  {\n    service := NewMessageService(MessageSenderEmail)\n    service.SendVerificationCode(\"10086\")\n  }\n  {\n    service := NewMessageService(MessageSenderShortMessage)\n    service.SendVerificationCode(\"10086\")\n  }\n}\n\n小结\n上面的实现方式违背了 OCP: 在增加新类型 ShortMessageSender 的同时，为了能使用这个类，需要同时修改函数 NewMessageService 与函数 MessageService::SendVerificationCode，手动确定使用哪种方式发送消息。\n并且可以确定以后每增加一种发送消息的类型，都需要同时修改这两个函数。\n重构\n首先，可以观察到，无论是通过类型 EmailMessageSender 发送消息，亦或是通过类型 ShortMessageSender 发送消息，二者对于 MessageService 都只是发送消息的一种实现方式，而 MessageService 并不关心具体使用的方式是什么。由此可以考虑将这个功能抽象为一个接口:\ntype Sender interface {\n  SendVerificationCode(code string)\n}\n\nMessageService 只需要持有这个接口即可:\ntype MessageService struct {\n  sender Sender\n}\n\nfunc NewMessageService(sender Sender) *MessageService {\n  return &amp;MessageService{\n    sender: sender,\n  }\n}\n\ntype (s *MessageService) SendVerificationCode(code string) {\n  s.sender.SendVerificationCode(code)\n}\n\n接下来就是水到渠成的事情，让 EmailMessageSender 与 ShortMessageSender 分别实现接口 Sender:\ntype EmailMessageSender struct {\n}\n\nfunc (e *EmailMessageSender) SendVerificationCode(code string) {\n  fmt.Println(\"Code: \", code)\n}\n\ntype ShortMessageSender struct {\n}\n\nfunc (e *ShortMessageSender) SendVerificationCode(code string) {\n  fmt.Println(\"Code: \", code)\n}\n\n最后，调用方式为:\nfunc main() {\n  {\n    service := NewMessageService(&amp;EmailMessageSender{})\n    service.SendVerificationCode(\"10086\")\n  }\n  {\n    service := NewMessageService(&amp;ShortMessageSender{})\n    service.SendVerificationCode(\"10086\")\n  }\n}\n\n使用这种方式，若要增加新的发送方式，只需要增加对应的类型，并使其实现接口 Sender 即可，而无需修改除 main 以外的其他函数。达到 open for extension but closed for modifications。\n总结\n开闭原则 的目标是指导如何 提高代码可扩展性，因此是众多设计模式主要遵从的设计原则。\n熟练使用这项原则，需要开发者具备扩展意识、抽象意识、封装意识等。在写代码之前，要认真思考，未来的需求可能会改变哪里。将可能的变化进行抽象，对外提供不变的接口。\n参考资料\n\nopen close

implementation.\n\n针对接口，而非实现编程 —— 出自 GoF《设计模式: 可复用面向对象软件基础》。接口 表示一组 协议 或 约定，是一组功能的集合。\n接口在不同的语言中，有不同的称呼:\n\nrust 中的 trait\ngo 中的 interface\nswift 中的 protocol\njava 中的 interface\n\n但无论他们的名字是否相同，其作用都是表达一组 抽象的功能集合。\n以上字面意思很好理解，下面来详细说明。\n为什么要针对接口编程\n初级开发者在实现某一具体需求时，其思考的关注点在于需求本身，分析实现这个需求要经过哪些步骤，每个步骤又要做那些事情，以此类推。在经过逐层分析，想明白流程之后，这名开发者就会把解决步骤转化为代码。\n如果只看这个需求，这名开发者完成并交付了这个功能。但是，当需求发生变动时，需要修改功能，或增加功能时，由于上面的实现方式是面向过程的，步骤与步骤之间互相暴露实现的细节。因此，当修改了某一个步骤的代码时，就非常可能需要同步修改前后相邻步骤的代码，最坏的情况可能要修改全部的代码。结果就是不小的开发工作量与测试工作量。\n如果开发者使用针对接口编程的方式，封装不稳定的实现细节，暴露稳定的接口。当需求发生变化时，只需要修改相关的接口实现，而因为接口不变，所以无需改动其他代码。\n举个例子\n产品给你分配了一个任务: 有一批保存在 aws s3 上的数据，需要你将它们同步到 aliyun oss 上。\n针对实现编程\n如果是使用针对实现编程方式，那么在收到这个需求之后，应该就会思考: 把 aws s3 的数据同步到 aliyun oss 上，步骤差不多是:\n\n想办法把数据从 aws s3 上下载到磁盘或者内存\n把磁盘或者内存中的数据上传到 aliyun oss\n\n想到这里，感觉差不多可以写代码了:\ntype AwsS3 struct {}\ntype AliyunOSS struct {}\n\ntype (s3 *AwsS3) Sync(oss *AliyunOSS, names []string) {\n  for _, name := ranges names {\n    data := s3.Download(name)\n    oss.Upload(name, data)\n  }\n}\n\n经过测试确认无误后，发布上线，成功运行了几个月没出现 Bug。\n需求变更\n后来呢，产品要求你有的数据要同步到 aliyun oss，有一些要同步到 ceph s3 上。你一看，这个需求简单啊，我会。然后，你把上面的代码复制了一份，稍加改动:\ntype CephS3 struct {}\n\ntype Meta struct {\n  Name     string\n  ToOss    bool\n  ToCephS3 bool\n}\n\ntype (s3 *AwsS3) syncToOss(oss *AliyunOSS, name string) {\n  data := s3.Download(name)\n  oss.Upload(name, data)\n}\n\ntype (s3 *AwsS3) syncToCephS3(cephs3 *CephS3, name string) {\n  data := s3.Download(name)\n  cephs3.Upload(name, data)\n}\n\ntype (s3 *AwsS3) Sync(oss *AliyunOSS, cephs3 *CephS3, metas *Meta) {\n  for _, meta := ranges metas {\n    data := s3.Download(meta.Name)\n    if meta.ToOss {\n      s3.syncToOss(oss, meta.Name)\n    }\n    if meta.ToCephS3 {\n      s3.syncToCephS3(cephs3, meta.Name)\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n不到一天的时间就完成了开发、测试，第二天就上线了。\n针对接口编程\n实现将数据从 aws s3 同步到 aliyun oss 上，可以提取到的信息包括 aws s3、aliyun oss 两种存储系统，同步是要实现的操作。\n由此引发思考，同步是一种动作，未来发生变化的可能性不大，或许有增加其他的动作可能，比如对比两个存储系统的内容，但这应该算作扩展需求，暂时无需考虑；但是存储系统就不好说了，现在是这样的要求，未来可能就会要求同步到 minio 上，或者同步到另一个 aws s3 上。\n至此，可以考虑将存储系统抽象为一组接口:\ntype Storage interface {\n  Upload(name string, data []byte)\n  Download(name string) []byte\n}\n\n再来思考，现在是要求从 aws s3 同步到 aliyun oss 上，既然上面已经认为未来有很大概率需要同步其他存储系统，由此提出问题: 如何确定同步的目标系统？先大胆猜测:\n\n一个服务只负责一种特定源到特定目标的同步任务\n在创建同步任务时指定，即在请求参数中，适用于本次任务的所有数据\n根据某种策略，或者是算法，确定每一个文件的源与目的分别是哪里\n\n那么接下来逐条分析:\n\n方法一，极其不灵活，如果有 n 个存储系统，那么一共需要启动 **nx(n-1)**个服务，无论是对于使用者，还是维护者来说，都可谓是灾难\n方法二，相比于方法一，极大地提高了灵活性，只需要一个服务就能替代上述 nx(n-1) 个服务\n方法三，相比于方法二，更进一步提高了灵活性，每一个文件都可以有独立的源与目标。但这种方法只是看起来很美好，很灵活，实际上可能并没有真实的使用场景。原因是，如果每一个文件都可以具有独立的目标，那么完全可以将目标相同的文件聚合到一起，作为一个批量的任务，这样就演变为了 方法二\n\n综上所述，下面实现 方法二:\ntype Batch struct {\n  From    string\n  Targets []string\n  Names   []string\n}\n\nfunc Sync(batch *Batch) {\n  from := NewStorage(batch.From)\n  targets := NewStorages(batch.Targets)\n  for _, name := range batch.Names {\n    data := from.Download(name)\n    for _, target := range targets {\n      target.Upload(name, data)\n    }\n  }\n} \n\n到此为止，所有代码都是面向接口编程，需求中提到的 aws s3 与 aliyun oss 还没有出现:\ntype AwsS3 struct {}\n\nfunc (s3 *AwsS3) Upload(name string, data []byte) {}\nfunc (s3 *AwsS3) Download(name string) []byte {}\n\ntype AliyunOSS struct {}\n\nfunc (s3 *AwsS3) Upload(name string, data []byte) {}\nfunc (s3 *AwsS3) Download(name string) []byte {}\n\n然后，需要实现两个函数:\nfunc NewStorage(name string) Storage {\n  switch name {\n    case \"awss3\":\n      return &amp;AwsS3{}\n    case \"aliyunoss\":\n      return AliyunOSS{}\n    default:\n      panic(\"unknown name: %s\", name) // 只作为演示 \n  }\n}\n\nfunc NewStorages(names string) []Storage {\n  var results []Storage\n  for _, name := range names {\n    results = append(results, NewStorage(name))\n  }\n  return results\n}\n\n到此为止，才终于完成了原始需求。使用面向实现方式的同学会说: 你这代码量要比面向实现的方法多很多，你实现了一个需求，我都实现好几个了。\n对此，我是不慌的。\n当产品要求将数据同步到 cephs3，minio 时，或者是从 tencent cos，本地磁盘同步到其他地方时，func Sync 是完全不需要改动的，代码的改动只有:\n\n增加对应的类型实现 Storage 接口:\n\ntype CephS3 struct {}\n\nfunc (ceph *CephS3) Upload(name string, data []byte) {}\nfunc (ceph *CephS3) Download(name string) []byte {}\n\ntype MinIO struct {}\n\nfunc (minio *MinIO) Upload(name string, data []byte) {}\nfunc (minio *MinIO) Download(name string) []byte {}\n\ntype Posix struct {}\n\nfunc (fs *Posix) Upload(name string, data []byte) {}\nfunc (fs *Posix) Download(name string) []byte {}\n\ntype TencentOSS struct {}\n\nfunc (oss *TencentOSS) Upload(name string, data []byte) {}\nfunc (oss *TencentOSS) Download(name string) []byte {}\n\n\n修改 func NewStorage:\n\nfunc NewStorage(name string) Storage {\n  switch name {\n    case \"awss3\":\n      return &amp;AwsS3{}\n    case \"aliyunoss\":\n      return AliyunOSS{}\n    case \"cephs3\":\n      return CephS3{}\n    case \"minio\":\n      return MinIO{}\n    case \"posix\":\n      return Posix{}\n    case \"tencentoss\":\n      return TencentOSS{}\n    default:\n      panic(\"unknown name: %s\", name) // 只作为演示 \n  }\n}\n\n就完成所有的修改了。如果是面向实现的方式，算了，我不想了。\n总结\n抽象会提升思维上的难度，但却能提高代码的灵活性。而且，灵活性还会随着抽象程度的提升一起提高。优秀的代码设计，不但能满足于眼前的需求，还提供了在不改变已有设计的前提支持对未来可能变化的需求的能力。\n","id":"https://blog.kiyoko.io/programming-program-to-an-interface/","title":"针对接口编程"},"https://blog.kiyoko.io/programming-single-responsibility-principle/":{"body":"\nA class or module should have a single responsibility.\n\n单一职责原则要求，一个类或模块只应该有唯一的职责。\n首先来明确概念，职责可以被看做一个类或者模块被修改的原因。那么，由这个概念可以得出，当一个类或者模块被修改的原因有两个或以上时，应该考虑将这些功能拆分到多个类或者模块中，从而使每一个类或者模块被修改的原因只有一个。\n那么，问题来了: 什么叫做单一职责，或者说，以类为例，如何判断一个类的职责是否单一？这个原则在字面上是非常简单的，但实际上却又非常主观。\n举个例子\n大多数业务中都会涉及到用户信息，例如:\ntype UserInfo struct {\n    ID                int64\n    Name              string\n    Email             string\n    Telephone         string\n    CreateTime        time.Time\n    LastLoginTime     time.Time\n    AvatarURL         string\n    ProvinceOfAddress Province\n    CityOfAddress     City\n    RegionOfAddress   Region\n    DetailedAddress   string\n}\n\n大部分的开发者会使用如上扁平化的数据结构，事实上也不会有什么问题。但本着从学术的角度出发，来审视一下 UserInfo 中的职责有哪些:\n\n调用接口时，作为唯一标志\n\nID\n\n\n展示作用\n\nName\nCreateTime\nLastLoginTime\nAvatarURL\n\n\n认证作用\n\nEmail\nTelephone\n\n\n地址信息\n\nProvinceOfAddress\nCityOfAddress\nRegionOfAddress\nDetailedAddress\n\n\n\n结果分析下来，竟然包含了四种职责。并且，这四种职责基本上是相互独立的，即任何一种职责的信息发生变化，基本不会影响其他职责的功能。\n同时，思考如下几个问题:\n\n用户登录的时候，是直接使用 UserInfo 类型做处理，还是使用只包含认证相关字段的类型 Credential 呢\n展示用户信息的时候，是直接使用 UserInfo 类型做处理，还是使用只包含展示信息字段的类型 UserDisplayInfo 呢\n在处理订单收货地址是，是直接使用 UserInfo 类型做处理，还是使用只包含地址相关字段的类型 Address 呢\n在计算发货地与收货地距离时，也要使用 UserInfo 类型处理吗\n\n如此看来，应该将 UserInfo 修改为:\ntype Credential struct {\n    Email             string\n    Telephone         string\n}\n\ntype UserDisplayInfo struct {\n    Name              string\n    CreateTime        time.Time\n    LastLoginTime     time.Time\n    AvatarURL         string\n}\n\ntype Address struct {\n    ProvinceOfAddress Province\n    CityOfAddress     City\n    RegionOfAddress   Region\n    DetailedAddress   string\n}\n\ntype UserInfo struct {\n    ID              int64\n    Credential      Credential\n    UserDisplayInfo UserDisplayInfo\n    Address         Address\n}\n\n但是，还有可能你开发的产品没有订单功能，这时候还有必要有 Address 类吗？\n因此，开篇才会说，这是一个主观的设计原则。职责是否单一还应该取决于实际的业务场景。\n参考资料\n\nOODesign: single responsibility principle\n\n","id":"https://blog.kiyoko.io/programming-single-responsibility-principle/","title":"单一职责原则"},"https://blog.kiyoko.io/projected-volumes/":{"body":"投射数据卷 的官方名称为: projected volume。Project 在这里的意思为 投射。感谢 k8s 帮助我学习英语。\n官方定义为:\n\nA projected volume maps several existing volume sources into the same directory.\n\nProjected Volumes 存在的意义不是为了存放容器里的数据，也不是用来进行容器和宿主机之间的数据交换。而是为容器提供预先定义好的数据。所以，从容器的角度来看，这些 Volume 里的信息就是仿佛是被 Kubernetes 投射 (Project) 进入容器当中的。到目前为止，Kubernetes 支持的 Projected Volume 一共有四种:\n\nSecret\nConfigMap\nDownward API\nServiceAccountToken。\n\n下面是官方给出的一个例子:\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: volume-test\nspec:\n  containers:\n  - name: container-test\n    image: busybox\n    volumeMounts:\n    - name: all-in-one\n      mountPath: \"/projected-volume\"\n      readOnly: true\n  volumes:\n  - name: all-in-one\n    projected:\n      sources:\n      - secret:\n          name: mysecret\n          items:\n            - key: username\n              path: my-group/my-username\n      - downwardAPI:\n          items:\n            - path: \"labels\"\n              fieldRef:\n                fieldPath: metadata.labels\n            - path: \"cpu_limit\"\n              resourceFieldRef:\n                containerName: container-test\n                resource: limits.cpu\n      -

Projected Volume。\n在有了初步认识之后，接下来对每一种 Projected Volume 做出更详细的说明。\nSecret\nSecret 最常见的用法是保存认证信息，比如数据库等。这些数据会被保存在内部的 ETCD 中，可以通过将 Secret 以 Volume 的形式挂载到 Pod 上的方式，允许 Pod 使用 Secret 中的数据。\n接下来介绍两种创建 Secret 以及使用的方式。\n命令行方式\n通过命令行创建 Secret\n使用如下命令创建两个 Secret:\necho 'admin' &gt; ./user.txt\necho 'password' &gt; ./pass.txt\n\nkubectl create secret generic user --from-file=./user.txt\nkubectl create secret generic pass --from-file=./pass.txt\n\n查询 Secret\n$ kubectl get secrets\nNAME                  TYPE                                  DATA   AGE\npass                  Opaque                                1      13s\nuser                  Opaque                                1      18s\n\n在 Pod 中使用 Secret\n生成一个 yaml 文件，引用上面的 Secret:\n# 生成 yaml，在 volumes.projected 中指定上面的 user 与 pass\n$ cat &lt;&lt; EOF &gt;&gt; busybox.yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: test-projected-volume\nspec:\n  containers:\n  - name: test-secret-volume\n    image: busybox\n    args:\n    - sleep\n    - \"86400\"\n    volumeMounts:\n    - name: mysql-cred\n      mountPath: \"/projected-volume\"\n      readOnly: true\n  volumes:\n  - name: mysql-cred\n    projected:\n      sources:\n      - secret:\n          name: user\n      - secret:\n          name: pass\nEOF\n\n# 创建 pod\n$ kubectl apply -f ./busybox.yaml\npod/test-projected-volume created\n\n在 Pod 中查看 Secret 数据\n进入到 Pod 中:\n$ kubectl exec -ti test-projected-volume -- sh\n/ #\n\n查看 Secret 数据:\n/ # ls /projected-volume/\nuser.txt\npass.txt\n/ # cat /projected-volume/user.txt\nadmin\n/ # cat /projected-volume/pass.txt\npassword\n\n可以看到，在 mountPath 指定的路径下面有预先定义好的 Secret，并且文件名就是 --from-file 指定的参数。\nyaml 方式\n通过 yaml 创建 Secret\n创建 Secret 的配置文件:\n$ cat &lt;&lt; EOF &gt;&gt; secret.yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nmetadata:\n  name: mysecret\ntype: Opaque\ndata:\n  user: YWRtaW4=\n  pass: cGFzc3dvcmQ=\nEOF\n\n在 Kubernetes 中创建 Secret:\n$ kubectl apply -f ./secret.yml\nsecret/mysecret created\n\n查询 Secret\n$ kubectl get secrets\nNAME                  TYPE                                  DATA   AGE\nmysecret              Opaque                                2      3m23s\n\n结果与使用命令行的方式有一些区别。\n在 Pod 中使用 Secret\n生成一个 yaml 文件，引用上面的 Secret，需要注意 secret.name 应使用 mysecret，同时，数量从刚才的 2个 变成了 1个:\n$ cat &lt;&lt; EOF &gt;&gt; busybox.yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: test-projected-volume\nspec:\n  containers:\n  - name: test-secret-volume\n    image: busybox\n    args:\n    - sleep\n    - \"86400\"\n    volumeMounts:\n    - name: mysql-cred\n      mountPath: \"/projected-volume\"\n      readOnly: true\n  volumes:\n  - name: mysql-cred\n    projected:\n      sources:\n      - secret:\n          name: mysecret\nEOF\n\n# 创建 pod\n$ kubectl apply -f ./busybox.yaml\npod/test-projected-volume created\n\n在 Pod 中查看 Secret 数据\n进入到 Pod 中:\n$ kubectl exec -ti test-projected-volume -- sh\n/ #\n\n查看 Secret 数据:\n/ # ls /projected-volume/\npass  user\n/ # cat /projected-volume/user\nadmin\n/ # cat /projected-volume/pass.txt\npassword\n\n可以看到，在 mountPath 指定的路径下面有预先定义好的 Secret，并且文件名就是创建 Secret 的 yaml 文件中，data 字段的 key，内容为对应 value 经过 base64 解码之后的结果。\nConfig Map\n与 Secret 相同的是，ConfigMap 也用于保存用户定义的配置信息；不同的是，ConfigMap 中的数据使用保持明文形式。\n比如，原始配置保存在 example/ui.properties 中，通过该文件创建一个 ConfigMap:\n# .properties文件的内容\n$ cat example/ui.properties\ncolor.good=purple\ncolor.bad=yellow\nallow.textmode=true\nhow.nice.to.look=fairlyNice\n\n# 从 .properties 文件创建 ConfigMap\n$ kubectl create configmap ui-config --from-file=example/ui.properties\n\n# 以 yaml 格式查看 ConfigMap 里保存的信息(data)\n$ kubectl get configmaps ui-config -o yaml\napiVersion: v1\ndata:\n  ui.properties: |\n    color.good=purple\n    color.bad=yellow\n    allow.textmode=true\n    how.nice.to.look=fairlyNice\nkind: ConfigMap\nmetadata:\n  name: ui-config\n  ...\n\nDownward API\n\nA downwardAPI volume is used to make downward API

perf，但是失败了，尝试在容器中使用 strace，提示没有权限。\n正在我继续死磕的时候，研发提供了另一段错误日志:\npytorch-956sg:9319:9379 [0] include/shm.h:48 NCCL WARN Error while creating shared memory segment nccl-shm-recv-183375136c5888b6-0-2-3 (size 9637888)\n\n这个错误就很有价值啊，创建共享内存失败。\n此前，反复与研发同学确认过，是否只依赖于外部的 NVIDIA Driver 与 CUDA，得到了肯定的答复。因此，就一直以此为前提进行排查。但现在我产生了怀疑，问研发要来启动命令，隐藏敏感数据后如下:\ndocker run -dit /data:/data --name asr --ipc=host image:latest /bin/bash\n\n果然就发现了隐藏信息: --ipc=host 。\n因此，修改在原有创建任务的 yaml 文件中增加 volume:\n   spec:\n     containers:\n       - name: asr\n         image: image:latest\n         volumeMounts:\n           - mountPath: /dev/shm\n             name: shm\n     volumes:\n       - name: shm\n         emptyDir:\n            medium: Memory\n\n在容器内，挂载一个 tmpfs 到 /dev/shm。成功解决上述两个问题。\n总结\n\n\n虽然成功解决了两个问题，但是对于第一个问题还是感到迷惑。虽然，根据答案反推原因，可以查到 DataLoader 在工作的时候会依赖于 shm。但是，查到的错误却不同于第一份错误日志。\n\n\n这次是运气好，遇到了第二个错误明显的提示。否则，可能就需要继续跟 perf，strace 作斗争了，甚至于调试 coredump。\n\n\n在遇到错误二之前，已经决定自己在新集群上使用 docker 运行看看了，其实，这样的话也能发现被隐藏的 --ipc=host。\n\n\n最终要的一点，不要轻易相信他人给定的条件。即使对方不是有意隐瞒，也可能会由于遗忘，或本来就不清楚等各种原因，导致丢失已知条件。\n\n\n","id":"https://blog.kiyoko.io/pytorch-fails-without-shm/","title":"未设置 shm 导致 PyTorch

This happens because a function (like `block_on`) attempted to block the current thread while the thread is being used to drive asynchronous tasks.', /home/divinerapier/.cargo/registry/src/github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823/tokio-1.6.0/src/runtime/enter.rs:39:9\n\n提示，不能在 Runtime 中执行另一个 Runtime。这里的第一个 Runtime 应该就是由 #[tokio::main] 自动创建的。\n使用当前的 Runtime\n在根据关键字 current 查找文档是，还存在另一个结果 tokio::runtime::Handle::current:\nimpl Handle {\n    /// Returns a `Handle` view over the currently running `Runtime`\n    ///\n    /// # Panic\n    ///\n    /// This will panic if called outside the context of a Tokio runtime.

ip: \"10.1.2.3\"\n    hostnames:\n    - \"foo.remote\"\n    - \"bar.remote\"\n...\n\n在 Pod 启动后，/etc/hosts 文件的内容将如下所示:\n$ cat /etc/hosts\n# Kubernetes-managed hosts file.\n127.0.0.1 localhost\n...\n10.244.135.10 hostaliases-pod\n10.1.2.3 foo.remote\n10.1.2.3 bar.remote\n\n其中，最下面两行记录，就是通过 HostAliases 字段写入的。\n特别注意: 在 Kubernetes 中，强烈建议使用这种方式设置 hosts 文件里的内容。如果使用直接修改 hosts 文件的方式，在 Pod 被删除重建之后，kubelet 会还原被修改的内容。\nShareProcessNamespace\n凡是跟容器的 Linux Namespace 相关的属性，也一定是 Pod 级别的。\n设计 Pod 的初衷，就是要让里面的容器尽可能多地共享 Linux Namespace，仅保留必要的隔离和限制能力。这样，Pod 之于 Container 就会更近似于虚拟机之于程序。\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: nginx\nspec:\n  shareProcessNamespace: true\n  containers:\n  - name: nginx\n    image: nginx\n  - name: shell\n    image: busybox\n    stdin: true\n    tty: true\n\nshareProcessNamespace: true 表示: Pod 里的 Containers 要共享 PID Namespace。\n共享宿主机的 Namespace\n\nHostPID - 控制 Pod 中容器是否可以共享宿主上的进程 ID 空间。 注意，如果与 ptrace 相结合，这种授权可能被利用，导致向容器外的特权逃逸 (默认情况下 ptrace 是被禁止的)。\nHostIPC - 控制 Pod 容器是否可共享宿主上的 IPC 名字空间。\nHostNetwork - 控制是否 Pod 可以使用节点的网络名字空间。 此类授权将允许 Pod 访问本地回路 (loopback) 设备、在本地主机 (localhost) 上监听的服务、还可能用来监听同一节点上其他 Pod 的网络活动。\nHostPorts -提供可以在宿主网络名字空间中可使用的端口范围列表。 该属性定义为一组 HostPortRange 对象的列表，每个对象中包含 min(含) 与 max(含) 值的设置。 默认不允许访问宿主端口。\n\n例如:\n\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: nginx\nspec:\n  hostNetwork: true\n  hostIPC: true\n  hostPID: true\n  containers:\n  - name: nginx\n    image: nginx\n  - name: shell\n    image: busybox\n    stdin: true\n    tty: true\n\nLifecycle\nContainer Lifecycle Hooks。顾名思义，是在容器状态发生变化时触发一系列 钩子。我们来看这样一个例子:\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: lifecycle-demo\nspec:\n  containers:\n  - name: lifecycle-demo-container\n    image: nginx\n    lifecycle:\n      postStart:\n        exec:\n          command: [\"/bin/sh\", \"-c\", \"echo Hello from the postStart handler &gt; /usr/share/message\"]\n      preStop:\n        exec:\n          command: [\"/usr/sbin/nginx\",\"-s\",\"quit\"]\n\n\n\nPostStart: 这个回调在创建容器之后立即执行。 但是，不能保证回调会在容器入口点 (ENTRYPOINT) 之前执行。没有参数传递给处理程序。\n\n\nPreStop: 在容器因 API 请求或者管理事件 (诸如存活态探针失败、资源抢占、资源竞争等) 而被终止之前，此回调会被调用。如果容器已经处于终止或者完成状态，则对 preStop 回调的调用将失败。此调用是阻塞的，也是同步调用，因此必须在删除容器的调用之前完成。没有参数传递给处理程序。\n\n\n\nKubernetes 只有在 Pod 结束 (Terminated) 的时候才会发送 preStop 事件，这意味着在 Pod 完成 (Completed) 时 preStop 的事件处理逻辑不会被触发。这个限制在 issue #55087 中被追踪。\n\n有关终止行为的更详细描述，请参见 终止 Pod。\nStatus\nPending。Pod 已被 Kubernetes 系统接受 (YAML 文件已经提交给了 Kubernetes)，但有一个或者多个容器尚未创建亦未运行。此阶段包括等待 Pod 被调度的时间和通过网络下载镜像的时间，\nRunning。Pod 已经绑定到了某个节点，Pod 中所有的容器都已被创建。至少有一个容器仍在运行，或者正处于启动或重启状态。\nSucceeded。Pod 中的所有容器都已成功终止，并且不会再重启。这种情况在运行一次性任务时最为常见。\nFailed。Pod 中的所有容器都已终止，并且至少有一个容器是因为失败终止。也就是说，容器以非 0 状态退出或者被系统终止。这个状态的出现，意味着你得想办法 Debug 这个容器的应用，比如查看 Pod 的 Events 和日志。\nUnknown。这是一个异常状态，意味着 Pod 的状态不能持续地被 kubelet 汇报给 kube-apiserver，这很有可能是主从节点(Master 和 Kubelet)间的通信出现了问题。\n参考文档\n\n在 Pod 中的容器之间共享进程命名空间\nShare Process Namespace between Containers in a Pod\nPod 安全策略\nPod Security Policies\nPod 的生命周期\nPod Lifecycle\n为容器的生命周期事件设置处理函数\n容器生命周期回调\n\n","id":"https://blog.kiyoko.io/the-basics-of-pods/","title":"Pod 的基本概念"},"https://blog.kiyoko.io/the-code-quality-metrics/":{"body":"可维护性 (maintainability)\n常见的代码维护工作，大体上包括: 修复 Bug，修改已有的代码，添加新的代码。可维护性就是用来衡量上述工作的难度。\n显而易见地，修改配置的难度小于修改编译参数，小于增加代码，小于改动已有代码。改动一处代码的难度小于改动多出代码，更小于改动不知道多少处代码。\n易于维护就要求，在不破坏原有代码设计、引入新 Bug 低风险的情况下，能够快速修改或者添加代码。反之，则是不易于维护。\n易于维护代码应该在兼具 可读性 的前提下，具有良好的模块化设计，做到高内聚低耦合，遵从面向接口而非实现的程序设计原则。\n但是，可维护性是一个偏主观的衡量标准。一段代码的可维护性依赖于代码量、业务复杂度、知识背景、文档完善度还有开发开发者水平等诸多方面的因素。\n同一段代码对于不同的开发者会具有不同的可维护性。\n可读性 (readability)\n\nMartin Fowler:\"Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.\"\n\n代码被阅读的次数远超过被编写的次数，无论是学习编程、修改代码、添加代码还是进行 Code Review 时，都需要对代码进行阅读。\n很多人都听说过 可读性，知道 可读性 很重要，但却并不重视。在实际写代码的时候，会为了 编写上舒服，为了 自以为的高效，为了 炫技 或者是其他什么原因，写出让其他人难以理解，甚至无法理解的代码。更有甚者，看不懂若干月之前自己写的代码。\n个人认为，可读性应被看做最重要的衡量标准。因为，无论是修复 Bug 还是开发新功能，只有先读懂代码，才能得到自己需要的信息去完成接下来的工作。若是读都读不懂，那么轻则工作效率事倍功半，加班成为常态；重则引入 Bug 影响绩效。\n衡量可读性可以从编码规范、命名、函数长度、模块划分、注释等方面切入。\n检测可读性可以通过 Code Review，如果同事读你的代码有很多疑问就表示需要提高可读性了。\n可扩展性 (extensibility)\n代码的可扩展性表示代码应对未来需求变化的能力。\n在添加新功能时，扩展性的高低反比与对已有代码修改的数量。修改的内容越少，则表示扩展性越好。如果能做到只通过扩展的方式添加新代码，而无需修改已有代码时，则表示代码具有非常好的可扩展性。\n灵活性 (flexibility)\n灵活性也是一个比较主观的衡量标准。例如:\n\n代码具有非常好的可扩展性\n底层模块抽象度高，封装良好，已于复用代码\n接口可以应对各种使用场景，满足各种不同的需求\n\n简洁性 (simplicity)\n\nKISS 原则: Kepp It Simple, Stupid.\n\n保持代码简单、结构简洁、逻辑清晰。因为，越简单的代码，越易于理解。避免在代码中引入不必要的设计模式，或其他炫技的写法。\n可复用性 (reusability)\n大部分开发者一定听过可复用性，也一定听过 Don't Repeat Yourself，也明白同样的代码只写一次，但却很少有人能真正做到，或者说是不知道如何做:\n\n面向对象的封装、继承、多态\n单一职责原则\n解耦，高内聚低耦合\n\n可测试性 (testability)\n编写易于单元测试的代码，如果为你的代码编写单元测试很困难，那你可能需要思考，你的一个函数或模块是不是做了太多的事情。\n","id":"https://blog.kiyoko.io/the-code-quality-metrics/","title":"代码质量衡量标准"},"https://blog.kiyoko.io/thundering-herd-problem/":{"body":"当计算机中存在大量的进程或线程被同一个事件唤醒，且该事件能且仅能被一个进程或线程响应的现象被称作惊群效应。此时，系统中相关的进程或线程都将争夺该资源，并大量浪费系统的性能。\nAccept 惊群\nAccept 流程\n\n代码示例\n#include &lt;arpa/inet.h&gt;\n#include &lt;assert.h&gt;\n#include &lt;errno.h&gt;\n#include &lt;netinet/in.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;string.h&gt;\n#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;\n#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;\n#include &lt;sys/wait.h&gt;\n#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;\n\n#define SERVER_ADDRESS \"0.0.0.0\"\n#define SERVER_PORT 10086\n#define WORKER_COUNT 4\n\nint worker_process(int listenfd, int i) {\n  while (1) {\n    printf(\"I am work %d, my pid is %d, begin to accept connections \\n\", i,\n           getpid());\n    struct sockaddr_in client_info;\n    socklen_t client_info_len = sizeof(client_info);\n    int connection =\n        accept(listenfd, (struct sockaddr *)&amp;client_info, &amp;client_info_len);\n    if (connection != -1) {\n      printf(\"worker %d accept success\\n\", i);\n      printf(\"ip :%s\\t\", inet_ntoa(client_info.sin_addr));\n      printf(\"port: %d \\n\", client_info.sin_port);\n    } else {\n      printf(\"worker %d accept failed\", i);\n    }\n    close(connection);\n  }\n\n  return 0;\n}\n\nint main() {\n  int i = 0;\n  struct sockaddr_in address;\n  bzero(&amp;address, sizeof(address));\n  address.sin_family = AF_INET;\n  inet_pton(AF_INET, SERVER_ADDRESS, &amp;address.sin_addr);\n  address.sin_port = htons(SERVER_PORT);\n  int listenfd = socket(PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);\n  int ret = bind(listenfd, (struct sockaddr *)&amp;address, sizeof(address));\n  ret = listen(listenfd, 5);\n  for (i = 0;

使用这些实体去表示整个集群的状态。特别地，它们描述了如下信息：\n\n哪些容器化应用在运行（以及在哪些节点上）\n可以被应用使用的资源\n关于应用运行时表现的策略，比如重启策略、升级策略，以及容错策略\n\nKubernetes 对象是 目标性记录，即一旦创建对象，Kubernetes 系统将持续工作以确保对象存在。 通过创建对象，本质上是在告知 Kubernetes 系统，所需要的集群工作负载看起来是什么样子的， 这就是 Kubernetes 集群的 期望状态（Desired State）。\n操作 Kubernetes 对象 —— 无论是创建、修改，或者删除 —— 需要使用 Kubernetes API。 比如，当使用 kubectl 命令行接口时，CLI 会执行必要的 Kubernetes API 调用， 也可以在程序中使用 客户端库 直接调用 Kubernetes API。\n对象规约（Spec）与状态（Status）\n几乎每个 Kubernetes 对象包含两个嵌套的对象字段，它们负责管理对象的配置： 对象 spec（规约） 和 对象 status（状态） 。 对于具有 spec 的对象，你必须在创建对象时设置其内容，描述你希望对象所具有的特征： 期望状态（Desired State） 。\nstatus 描述了对象的 当前状态（Current State），它是由 Kubernetes 系统和组件 设置并更新的。在任何时刻，Kubernetes 控制平面 都一直积极地管理着对象的实际状态，以使之与期望状态相匹配。\n例如，Kubernetes 中的 Deployment 对象能够表示运行在集群中的应用。 当创建 Deployment 时，可能需要设置 Deployment 的 spec，以指定该应用需要有 3 个副本运行。 Kubernetes 系统读取 Deployment 规约，并启动我们所期望的应用的 3 个实例 —— 更新状态以与规约相匹配。 如果这些实例中有的失败了（一种状态变更），Kubernetes 系统通过执行修正操作 来响应规约和状态间的不一致 —— 在这里意味着它会启动一个新的实例来替换。\n关于对象 spec、status 和 metadata 的更多信息，可参阅 Kubernetes API 约定。\n描述 Kubernetes 对象\n创建 Kubernetes 对象时，必须提供对象的规约，用来描述该对象的期望状态， 以及关于对象的一些基本信息（例如名称）。 当使用 Kubernetes API 创建对象时（或者直接创建，或者基于kubectl）， API 请求必须在请求体中包含 JSON 格式的信息。 大多数情况下，需要在 .yaml 文件中为 kubectl 提供这些信息。 kubectl 在发起 API 请求时，将这些信息转换成 JSON 格式。\n这里有一个 .yaml 示例文件，展示了 Kubernetes Deployment 的必需字段和对象规约：\napiVersion: apps/v1 # for versions before 1.9.0 use apps/v1beta2\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: nginx-deployment\nspec:\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: nginx\n  replicas: 2 # tells deployment to run 2 pods matching the template\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: nginx\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: nginx\n        image: nginx:1.14.2\n        ports:\n        - containerPort: 80\n\n使用类似于上面的 .yaml 文件来创建 Deployment的一种方式是使用 kubectl 命令行接口（CLI）中的 kubectl apply 命令， 将 .yaml 文件作为参数。下面是一个示例：\nkubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/deployment.yaml --record\n\n输出类似如下这样：\ndeployment.apps/nginx-deployment created\n\n必需字段\n在想要创建的 Kubernetes 对象对应的 .yaml 文件中，需要配置如下的字段：\n\napiVersion - 创建该对象所使用的 Kubernetes API 的版本\nkind - 想要创建的对象的类别\nmetadata - 帮助唯一性标识对象的一些数据，包括一个 name 字符串、UID 和可选的 namespace\n\n你也需要提供对象的 spec 字段。 对象 spec 的精确格式对每个 Kubernetes 对象来说是不同的，包含了特定于该对象的嵌套字段。 Kubernetes API 参考 能够帮助我们找到任何我们想创建的对象的 spec 格式。 例如，可以从 core/v1 PodSpec 查看 Pod 的 spec 格式， 并且可以从 apps/v1 DeploymentSpec 查看 Deployment 的 spec 格式。\n参考资料\n\n理解 Kubernetes 对象\n控制平面\n\n","id":"https://blog.kiyoko.io/understanding-kubernetes-objects/","title":"理解 Kubernetes

(a AND b AND c) OR (a AND b AND c AND d)\n\n\n\n常量替换(Constant folding)\n(a&lt;b AND b=c) AND a=5\n-&gt; b&gt;5 AND b=c AND a=5\n\n\n\n删除恒定条件\n(b&gt;=5 AND b=5) OR (b=6 AND 5=5) OR (b=7 AND 5=6)\n-&gt; b=5 OR b=6\n\n在 MySQL 8.0.14 和更高版本中，这是在准备过程中发生的，而不是在优化阶段发生的，这有助于简化联接。 有关更多信息和示例，请参见 Section 8.2.1.9, “Outer Join Optimization”。\n\n\n索引使用的常量表达式仅计算一次。\n\n\n从 MySQL 8.0.16 开始，数值类型的列与常数比较时，折叠(folded)或删除无效或越界的值：\n-- CREATE TABLE t (c TINYINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL);\nSELECT * FROM t WHERE c ≪ 256;\n-≫ SELECT * FROM t WHERE 1;\n\n\n\n对于使用MyISAM 和 MEMORY存储引擎的表，在单一表上执行 COUNT(*) 操作时，如果没有 WHERE 子句，或者 WHERE 子句的表达式 NOT NULL，都将直接从表信息中读取。\n\nCOUNT(*) on a single table without a WHERE is retrieved directly from the table information for MyISAM and MEMORY tables. This is also done for any NOT NULL expression when used with only one table.\n\n\n\n尽早检测无效的常量表达式。MySQL 检测到无效 SELECT 语句时，直接返回无结果。\n\n\n不使用 GROUP BY 或聚合函数(COUNT()，MIN())时，会把 HAVING 与 WHERE 合并。\n\n\n对于联接查询中的每个表，构造一个简单的 WHERE 实现快速 WHERE 评估，尽快跳过行的目的。\n\n\n优先读取常量表。满足以下任意一个即为常量表：\n\n空表或具有一行的表。\n使用 WHERE 语句构建得到的表，且 WHERE 子句中的所有列只能是 PRIMARY KEY 或 NOT NULL UNIQUE 索引与常量表达式比较。\n\n以下所有表均用作常量表：\nWHERE primary_key=1;\n\nWHERE t1.primary_key=1 AND t2.primary_key=t1.id;\n\n-- PRIMARY KEY (column1,column2)\nWHERE column1=5 AND column2=7\n\n-- unique_not_null_column INT NOT NULL UNIQUE\nWHERE unique_not_null_column=5\n\n参考 7.2.1.4 Constants and Constant Tables 了解更多有关常量与常量表。\n\n\n通过尝试所有可能的方法，找到用于联接表的最佳联接组合。如果 ORDER BY 和 GROUP BY 子句中的所有列都来自同一表，则在连接时优先使用该表。\n\n\n如果 ORDER BY 子句和 GROUP BY 子句使用不同的列，或者 ORDER BY/GROUP BY 使用的列不属于联接队列中第一个表，则会创建一个临时表。\n\nIf there is an ORDER BY clause and a different GROUP BY clause, or if the ORDER BY or GROUP BY contains columns from tables other than the first table in the join queue, a temporary table is created.\n\n\n\n如果使用 SQL_SMALL_RESULT 修饰符，MySQL 将使用内存临时表。\n\n\n从表的所有索引中选择一个最佳索引使用。或者，优化器认为全表扫描更有效时，会选择全表扫描。曾经，当使用最佳索引仍然会跨越表的 30%(spanned more than 30% of the table)时，就会选择使用全表扫描。但现在，使用索引还是全表扫描不再只取决于固定百分比，同时还要考虑其他因素，例如表大小，行数和 I/O 块大小。\n\n\n在某些情况下，MySQL 可以从索引中读取数据行，而无需查询数据文件。如果索引中使用的所有列都是数字列，则仅使用索引树解析查询。\n\n\n在输出每一行之前，将跳过与 HAVING 子句不匹配的行。\n\n\n","id":"https://blog.kiyoko.io/where-clause-optimization/","title":"优化 WHERE 子句"},"https://blog.kiyoko.io/why-do-we-need-pods/":{"body":"容器的局限性\n既然要讨论 Pod 的意义，或许可以想象一个如果没有 Pod 会是什么样子。\n假设，有如下需求: 使用容器化来部署一个支持自动更新数据的文件服务。可以使用如下方法解决:\n\n在一个容器中，同时运行两个进程，一个进程提供文件服务，一个进程定时更新数据。\n\n优点:\n\n无论是编码，还是部署都十分的容易，就像在物理机或者虚拟机里面一样\n\n\n缺点:\n\n容器的本质是进程，对操作系统而言是那个由 entrypoint 指定的进程，其他进程都是其子进程，或子进程的子进程等。而且，entrypoint 没有回收僵尸进程的能力。\n耦合严重\n\n\n\n\n每个进程分别位于各自的容器，两个容器之间通过挂载相同的外部 volume 实现容器间共享文件系统。\n\n优点:\n\n将两个容器解耦，保证功能单一性\n\n\n缺点:\n\n通过共享外部 volume 的方式无法保证数据安全性，其他容器，或宿主机也能直接访问 volume\n\n\n\n\n在上一个方法的基础上，通过 --volume-from 指定从其他的 container 挂载 volume。\n\n优点:\n\n避免对外直接暴露 volume\n\n\n\n\n\n到此为止，一切似乎很顺利，没有在创建 Pod 这样一个新的概念。\n但上述方案有一个局限性，--volume-from 的目标容器只能是本地的其他 container。\n假设，使用 Docker Swarm 部署服务。为了便于叙述，做出如下定义:\n\n集群中存在两个节点。node-0 剩余 2G 内存，node-1 剩余 1.5G 内存\n两个容器 container-0 与 container-1 各需要 1G 内存\n部署过程，先启动 container-0，后启动 container-1\n\n因此，为了让两个容器能够运行在同一个 Node 上，需要在启动 container-1 时增加限制 affinity=container-0。\n此时，如果 container-0 被调度到了 node-1 上，node-1 将剩余 0.5G 内存。接下来，调度 container-1 时，Docker Swarm 就会发现无法找到一个合适的 Node 来启动 container-1。\n以上问题被称作 Gang Scheduling。\n而 Kuberntes 则通过 Pod 解决了这个问题。\nPod 是 Kubernetes 中最小的可调度计算单元。在处理上述问题中，如果将 container-0 与 container-1 同时包含在一个 Pod 中，Kubernetes 在调度这个 Pod 时就只会考虑剩余内存不小于 2G 的 node-0。\n对于上面这种，相互之间直接访问文件系统、使用 localhost 或 socket 文件进行本地通信，共享某些 Namespace 的一组容器，称之为 超亲密关系。\nPod 实现原理\nPod 是一个逻辑概念。其本质是一组共享了 Network Namespace，并且可以声明共享同一个 Volume 的容器。\n比如，一个包含了 A 与 B 两个容器的 Pod，按照 定义 的描述，可以使用如下 Docker 命令模拟:\n# start container A\n$ docker run --net=B --volumes-from=B --name=A image-A ...\n\n但此时会发现，Pod 内的一组容器要遵循某个特定的顺序启动，容器与容器之间不再是对等关系，而是拓扑关系。\n所以，在 Kubernetes 项目里，通过增加一个被称作 Infra 的容器作为 Pod 里第一个启动的容器。用户定义的其他容器通过 Join Network Namespace 的方式，关联到 Infra 容器。这样的组织关系，可以用下面这样一个示意图来表达:\n\n如上图所示，这个 Pod 里有两个用户容器 A 和 B，还有一个 Infra 容器。这个特殊容器的镜像地址为 k8s.gcr.io/pause，源代码位于 github。同时，kubelet 提供参数 --pod-infra-container-image 支持自定义镜像。\n所以，当容器 A、B 加入到 Infra 容器的 Network Namespace 后，对于容器 A、B 而言:\n\n可以直接使用 localhost 进行通信\n看到的网络设备跟 Infra 容器看到的完全一样\n一个 Pod 只有一个 IP 地址，也就是这个 Pod 的 Network Namespace 对应的 IP 地址\n其他的所有网络资源，都是一个 Pod 一份，并且被该 Pod 中的所有容器共享\nPod 的生命周期只跟 Infra 容器一致，而与容器 A、B 无关。\n\n而对于同一个 Pod 里面的所有用户容器来说，它们的进出流量，也可以认为都是通过 Infra 容器完成的。这一点很重要，因此为 Kubernetes 开发网络插件时，应该重点考虑的是如何配置这个 Pod 的 Network Namespace，而不是每一个用户容器如何使用网络配置。\n而且，在这这个设计模型之下，可以方便的共享 volume: Kubernetes 项目只要把所有 volume 的定义都设计在 Pod 层级即可。之后，Pod 内的容器再声明挂载这个 volume 从而达到共享 volume 的目的。\n\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name:

里的多个容器。\n要理解这个概念，也很容易。只需要将 Pod 理解为原来的虚拟机即可。\n在虚拟机时代，服务之间也存在一定的关系。有上述那样需要共享本地文件系统的关系，也有 API Service 与 DB 之间的关系。\n当需要考虑是否需要将多个容器描述成一个 Pod 时，可以想象一下: 如果使用虚拟机部署，是否应该将这些服务部署在同一台虚拟机上。如果需要部署在一台虚拟机才能工作，那么就需要描述为一个 Pod。\n参考文档\n\nKuberntes Documentation: Pod\n为什么说容器是单进程模型\nUse “affinity filter” in “docker service create”\nThe Almighty Pause

light\ntabWidthMode: tab 显示长度，可以是 equal, titleLength, compact\n\n配置终端\nprofiles 用于配置具体的终端，其包含如下两部分:\n{\n    \"profiles\": {\n        \"defaults\": {\n            // SETTINGS TO APPLY TO ALL PROFILES\n        },\n        \"list\": [\n            // PROFILE OBJECTS\n        ]\n    }\n}\n\n默认终端配置\n\n\nprofiles.defaults: 中的配置对所有的终端有效。\n\n\nprofiles.list: 包含所有可用的终端，配置只对当前终端。\n\n\nguid: 配置文件可将 GUID 用作唯一标识符。 若要将某个配置文件设置为默认配置文件，则需要 defaultProfile 全局设置的 GUID，为必填项\n\n\ncolorScheme: 终端使用的配色方案，需要在 schemes 中目标配色方案\n\n\nhidden: 在下拉列表中是否隐藏，默认为 false\n\n\nname: \"在下拉列表中显示的名字\n\n\ntabTitle: 在 tab 上显示的名字，会覆盖 name，需要与 suppressApplicationTitle 一起使用才会生效。若要了解如何使 shell 设置标题，请访问tab title tutorial\n\n\nsuppressApplicationTitle: 设置为 true 时，tabTitle 会替代 tab 的默认标题，并将禁止应用程序的任何标题更改消息。 如果未设置 tabTitle，将改为使用 name\n\n\nantialiasingMode: 抗锯齿模式，可以为 grayscale、cleartype、aliased\n\n\nicon: 显示图标，\"ms-appdata:///roaming/archlinux-512.webp\"\n\n\nacrylicOpacity: 窗口透明度，[0, 1] 之内的浮点数，需要配合 useAcrylic 一起使用\n\n\nuseAcrylic: 是否是否透明效果\n\n\nstartingDirectory: 起始目录位置，比如 \\\\\\\\wsl$\\\\Ubuntu-20.04\\\\home\\\\alice\n\n\nms-appdata 在什么位置\nWindows Terminal 是一个 UWP 应用(如果是在应用商店下载的话)，会有属于自己的 appdata 目录，位于:\n%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Packages\\Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_8wekyb3d8bbwe\\RoamingState\n\n在文件管理器中打开这个目录放入数据，Windows Terminal 即可通过 ms-appdata:\\\\\\ 的方式获取到。\n配色方案\n可以在 themes 定义一系列的配色方案，要求每个配色方案要有一个唯一的 name。除 name 以外，每个设置都接受十六进制格式 (#rgb 或 #rrggbb) 的字符串形式的颜色。 cursorColor 和 selectionBackground 设置是可选的。\n如果要在一个命令行配置文件中设置配色方案，请添加 colorScheme 属性，并将配色方案的 name 作为值。\n自定义快捷键\n内容太多，请查看官方文档。\n参考文档\n\nWindows Terminal\nHow to Customize the New Windows Terminal App\nCustom key bindings in Windows
